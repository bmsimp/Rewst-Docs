<summary>⚠️ Transition to OAuth 2.0 Authentication for Pax8 APIs (January 7th, 2025)</summary>

As of **January 31st, 2025**, Pax8 will retire API Key requests as a method of authentication. To ensure uninterrupted access to the Pax8 integration, Rewst customers are required to transition to OAuth 2.0 for API authentication.

To continue using the Pax8 integration with Rewst, you will need to transition to OAuth 2.0 authentication before January 31st, 2025. For information on how to update the configuration in Rewst, check this page: [pax8-2025-oauth-transition-planning.md](../documentation/integrations/licensing/pax8/pax8-2025-oauth-transition-planning.md "mention")

This transition to OAuth 2.0 provides enhanced security, streamlined user experience, and improved API access management.&#x20;

If you have any questions or need assistance with the transition, our team is here to help.

<summary>⚠️ Upgrade to V4 of ConnectSecure needed by December 31st, 2024</summary>

We’re excited to share an important update regarding your ConnectSecure integrations (formerly CyberCNS). To enhance functionality and ensure seamless performance, we’ve developed a new V4 version of the ConnectSecure integration. This update is designed to provide improved capabilities and long-term support as we transition from the V3 integration, which will reach its end-of-life on December 31st, 2024.

While the migration to V4 requires a few configuration steps, we’ve made the process straightforward. Simply reach out to your ConnectSecure representative or log in to your ConnectSecure instance to obtain your V4 credentials and hostname. Please note that related endpoints in your existing generic actions will also need to be updated to the new URLs.

To make the transition as smooth as possible, we’ve created detailed migration documentation, which you can find here: [https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/security/cybercns/connectsecure-integration-migration-v3-to-v4](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/security/cybercns/connectsecure-integration-migration-v3-to-v4).

We’re here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out to our team.Thank you for partnering with Rewst as we continue to enhance your experience with ConnectSecure!

<summary>⚠️ Resolved: Rewst Experiencing Performance Degradation for US Region (November 1st, 2024)</summary>

### Issue Resolved

**Date**: Friday, November 1st, 2024\
**Time**: 4:30 PM EDT

After further investigation, it was discovered that a previous settings change intended to improve performance was causing timeouts because of the large number of connections in the environment. Upon reverting the setting, performance returned back to normal around 4:30PM EDT.

### Issue Identified

**Date:** Friday, November 1st, 2024

**Time:** 11:58 AM EST

ReOn Friday, November 1, 2024 beginning at 10:23AM EDT, the workflow engine began exhibiting slow performance while executing tasks. Our platform team was alerted when the pending task queue grew out of normal boundaries and began investigating the problem.

### Updates

**Time:** 2:00 PM EST\
\
Investigation showed that increasing the number of worker nodes had an adverse affect on workflow processing, pointing to a potential issue with the message queue system experiencing timeouts. To stabilize the task queues, the team adjusted the number of worker nodes until processing normalized, while continuing to troubleshoot the root cause. By 2PM EDT, the task processing rate was normalized, although still slower than normal.
