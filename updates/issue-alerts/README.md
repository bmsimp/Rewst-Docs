<summary>⚠️Resolved: SQL Database Integration – Refactor Issues - AU, EU, UK, and US Region January 13, 2026</summary>

Release 4.83 SQL Database integration refactor triggered multiple related issues over 4 days,\
including configuration loss for some organizations, custom SSL certificates breaking, and\
MSSQL datetime handling failure. Full mitigation was achieved through multiple hotfixes and\
manual configuration restoration through January 9th.

Customers should review any SQL Database configurations and workflows using the integration to ensure they are set as expected and have run correctly. Workflows that failed during the issues may need to be re-run; for any customers with large numbers of workflows that have not already been re-run, please reach out to your Customer Success representative so we can support you.

<summary>⚠️ Resolved: Microsoft Azure Secret Expiration - AU, EU, UK, and US Region January 12, 2026. </summary>

On Sunday, January 11th at 2:17 AM ET, an issue was identified that affected workflows using\
Microsoft integrations. This was caused by an authentication credential that required renewal, which also impacted Slack and PagerDuty integrations. The Rewst team responded immediately and the production environment was fully restored by 2:44 am ET.

Any workflows that failed during the outage should be re-run if they have not already. For customers with large numbers of impacted workflows that still need to be re-run, please reach out to your Customer Success representative for support.

<summary>⚠️ Concluded: Planned maintenance window - US region November 16th, 2025</summary>

On Sunday, November 16th at 9:00 AM EDT, Rewst will be performing brief maintenance on the US instance [app.rewst.io](http://app.rewst.io/). Our engineering team will be migrating US users to our new permissions system. Due to the size of our US region, we expect up to 30 minutes where creating new entities, such as organizations or users, will result in under-provisioning or lack of access. Affected entities include:

* Organizations
* Users
* Custom roles
* App Builder apps

Normal operation will resume immediately after the work is complete, at which point we'll also provide a detailed report of all entities created during the affected period. We recommend that you plan to not update any of the affected entities during the window.

<summary>⚠️ Resolved: Service performance issue - US region October 8th, 2025</summary>

On October 8, 2025, following a routine platform deployment, our US region experienced degraded performance affecting workflow execution speeds. From 10:30 AM EDT to 12:31 PM EDT, customers may have noticed slower task completion times and some webhook timeouts.

During this platform update, we introduced an enhancement to improve task log storage by writing data to cloud storage in addition to the existing database storage method. However, the new implementation opened a new AWS connection for each task log operation instead of reusing existing connections. This led to excessive resource use on our workflow processing servers and temporary performance degradation.\
\
Our engineering team identified the issue within approximately 30 minutes of the update’s completion and deployed a fix. Service was fully restored by 12:31 PM EDT. It's recommended that all customers verify that tasks executed in their workflows executed as expected during this degradation window.\
\
We apologize for any inconvenience this incident caused. We take platform stability seriously and are committed to learning from this incident to provide you with more reliable service. The swift detection and resolution demonstrates our team's ability to respond quickly to issues, and the improvements we're implementing will help prevent similar issues in the future.&#x20;

During this brief window, the Rewst platform, including the user interface, API access, and workflow execution, will be temporarily unavailable.

<summary>⚠️ Transition to OAuth 2.0 authentication for Pax8 APIs - January 7th, 2025</summary>

As of **January 31st, 2025**, Pax8 will retire API Key requests as a method of authentication. To ensure uninterrupted access to the Pax8 integration, Rewst customers are required to transition to OAuth 2.0 for API authentication.

To continue using the Pax8 integration with Rewst, you will need to transition to OAuth 2.0 authentication before January 31st, 2025. For information on how to update the configuration in Rewst, check this page: [Broken link](/broken/pages/JTewUNxCZGcGg3FdP57W "mention")

This transition to OAuth 2.0 provides enhanced security, streamlined user experience, and improved API access management.&#x20;
