* The team is back from an onsite with a TON of awesome ideas for the coming weeks and months! So here are a few teasers of what you can anticipate:
  * **Contributing to Documentation**: We're thrilled to open up our documentation for user contributions. Stay tuned for eligibility criteria and the ability to enhance our community knowledge base. Quick-Fix Contributions can be made today by clicking the "Edit on GitHub" within the three dots at the top right of any page! Check out our [Community Corner page for more information](broken-reference).
  * **200 Series Courses**: These courses will focus on a deep dive into programming concepts, data types, and anti-patterns. Perfect for those looking to optimize their workflows and ensure responsible product use. Look forward to the 201, coming in October!
  * **More Electives**: These specialized modules will address specific skills and use cases, providing a more tailored learning experience.

With the ROC now using Halo for their ticketing system, this is when you should find a ticket created for you!

* [x] A discussion with a ROC engineer that doesn't result in a fix on first discussion
* [x] If you have a call to troubleshoot, create workflows or other ROC work
* [x] For all onboarding or expansion work
