* **Game Suggestion for the Week:** Sea of Stars has a physical copy you can pre-order from Iam8bit. If you missed this bad boy in 2023, and you're like me and prefer to have physical copies that you own, check it out!
* **SHOUT OUT** to Grant for successfully taking our [foundations-certification.md](../../cluck-university/rewst-foundations/foundations-certification.md "mention")Exam, and collecting your prestigious **Certified Rewster** badge in Discord.&#x20;

- **Reminder about the Rewst Onsite:**
  * Training will be paused again the week of **January 22nd** due to the Rewst Onsite!&#x20;
  * Feel free to sit by the fire, with a glass of bourbon, or tasty leftover New Year drinks, and watch our videos while you wait with anticipation for our return on **January 29th**.
