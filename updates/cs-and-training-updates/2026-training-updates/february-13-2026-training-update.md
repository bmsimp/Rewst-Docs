<summary><strong>Cluck University updates and shoutouts</strong> </summary>

* We've updated [learning paths](https://learn.rewst.io/page/new-certificates) and certificates to provide a more scaffolded learning journey and validate automation project leadership.
* The new [Automation Fundamentals path](https://learn.rewst.io/path/automation-fundamentals) includes an intro course, Process engineering, and the IMPACT Framework intro along with a "feedback" course that validates your certificate of completion. It's ideal for project managers, automation champions, and technical builders.
* Technical builders should take the new [Automation Builder Basics](https://learn.rewst.io/path/automation-builder-basics) courses (and earn their certificate of completion). This path focuses on building a simple workflow, using a completion handler with Crates (a common pattern for customizing prebuilt automations safely), and troubleshooting.
* [Rewst Foundations and Clean Automation content](https://learn.rewst.io/page/advanced-builder-certificates) is unchanged; training completion is now required for access to the certification courses. If you don't pass at first, you can retry right away — no more waiting period.
