We've been receiving a ton of feedback around making adjustments to your forms so we're currently working on a few exciting updates and have things we can help you implement right now!

**What can I implement right now?**

* Hide fields that don't need to be on your forms
* Dynamically show/hide values based on different variables
* Assign default values with org variables

**What are you working on next?**

* Changes to "Bring Your Own Database" so you can add default values more easily
* Ability to create a new user based on settings from a similar existing user
