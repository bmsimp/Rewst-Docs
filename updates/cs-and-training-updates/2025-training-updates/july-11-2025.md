<summary><strong>Cluck U and Documentation Updates</strong></summary>

**What's New at Cluck University?**

* We've updated our [live training offerings](https://learn.rewst.io/page/live-training)!
  * [Automation Basics ](https://learn.rewst.io/path/automation-basics)is on-demand only. For live support, sign up for [Office Hours](https://learn.rewst.io/cluck-university-office-hours) -- now available every Friday morning. We can help with Automation Basics and any other Cluck University content!
  * [Rewst Foundations](https://learn.rewst.io/live-training-rewst-foundations) consists of three (3) hour-long sessions. To make the most of these shorter, fast-paced sessions, we strongly recommend completing the [Process engineering](https://learn.rewst.io/process-engineering-designed-for-automation) and [Automation Basics ](https://learn.rewst.io/path/automation-basics)courses in advance.
  * [Clean Automation](https://learn.rewst.io/live-training-clean-automation) takes place monthly in three (3) hour-long sessions. We've cut 2 sessions, and recommend taking [Jinja in action](https://learn.rewst.io/jinja-in-action) in advance to fill in the gaps.
  * We launched a new course: [Rewst technical pre-assessment](https://learn.rewst.io/rewst-technical-pre-assessment). Find out whether you should start with Automation Basics or skip ahead to Rewst Foundations with a quiz that checks your baseline knowledge. You'll receive an email with personalized learning recommendations after you submit the quiz.
