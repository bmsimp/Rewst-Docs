# Cluck University Capped  🎓 — 2025 Rewst Education Roundup

Buckle up for a **year of learning Rewst** recap, proudly presented by the Rewst Education team (_Clea, Eddie, and Lauren — you can find them in Rewst Discord at #cluck-u)._

In 2025, we made it easier to **learn Rewst and find answers faster**. [Docs.Rewst.Help](http://docs.rewst.help) is now optimized for quick reference, and training lives in [Cluck University](https://www.notion.so/2b4b56f9907181969fb6f55ad238ab16?pvs=21) so you can follow learning paths, track progress, and earn certificates as you build.

We ended the year smarter than ever, with the certificates to prove it — over 1,000 Rewst staff and partners are certified in Rewst Foundations and Clean Automation!

<details>

<summary><strong>Documentation improvements</strong> </summary>

This year, we shipped major upgrades to documentation coverage and quality:

* Docs for **101** previously undocumented **Crates (prebuilt automations)**, including workflow breakdowns and action explanations
* Docs for **27** previously undocumented integrations
* Refreshed action and endpoint tables in docs for **95%** of all live integrations

And we improved the user experience in our site:

* Reorganized left-hand navigation to match the Rewst platform navigation and improve search results
* Began to incorporate feedback from our first documentation survey to (_if you missed it, participate next time)_

But that’s not all — we fed our RoboRewsty in-app assistant the latest and greatest documentation information, and refined how it all works behind-the-scenes to give you more accurate answers to technical questions.

<summary><strong>Finding a new home for Rewst training</strong></summary>

Docs and training solve different problems, so we split them to make both better.

* **Docs**: Step-by-step technical details on Rewst platform features, integrations, and more
* **Cluck University**: Guided learning paths, course progress tracking, and improved certificate exam experience

At the start of the year, training content lived inside Docs as checklist-style subpages. It worked for a while, but as we expanded our training courses it was hard to figure out where to start or track your progress.

#### **Launched March 31, 2025**

We migrated from basic Docs pages to a full learning management system (LMS) with 10+ comprehensive Rewst onboarding courses featuring detailed guidance, documentation links, and demo videos on the most popular tools and trickier concepts (like organization structure, variable inheritance, and how it all matters for your automations).

And we enhanced our foundational series — Automation Basics, Rewst Foundations, and Clean Automation — making it easier to pick and choose bite-sized self-paced courses or attend live training with the legendary Eddie Chow.

#### **New courses launched in 2025**

Based on your feedback, and in collaboration with Rewst teams like Customer Success, Automation Strategy, and ROC/Support, we identified and closed gaps in your Rewst automation knowledge base.

Here’s what we launched and when:

#### **Quality over quantity**

With so much new content, we carefully reviewed everything to ensure courses remain helpful, up-to-date, and goal-oriented. We deprecated 15 older courses with lower engagement and replaced them with improved content.

#### **Everyone’s first course**

Recognizing that not everyone has time for extensive training, we created a streamlined "first course for everyone" that includes a platform overview, key concepts that power Rewst automations, and guidance on what course(s) to take next, based on your needs and goals.

<summary><strong>Live training evolution</strong></summary>

**Finding the right format**

We experimented with different session frequencies and lengths to maximize instructor time while respecting yours. The result: a blended learning approach that combines self-paced prerequisites with focused, one-hour live sessions.

**Streamlined live sessions**

* [Rewst Foundations](https://learn.rewst.io/live-training-rewst-foundations): Reduced from three 2.5-hour sessions to three 1-hour sessions by assigning Automation Basics content as prerequisites
* [Clean Automation](https://learn.rewst.io/live-training-clean-automation): Reduced from five 1-hour sessions to three 1-hour sessions with Jinja in Action prerequisites

If you prefer live training delivery but can never make the times work, we got you covered — register for those live courses (above) and jump into the video lessons that we added in September!
