# October 14th 2022 - QOL Changes & With Items Walkthrough

First things first, the ROC is growing! This week we introduced Matt Reid who's joining the ROC to help build your next awesome workflow. The focus this week is on showing off some features that will make your life easier when using Rewst. We'll introduce the ability to copy and paste actions within and across workflows, add all orgs to triggers, where to find a dynamic URL for forms and how to change values when rerunning a workflow.

We also take a closer look at using With Items for looping in workflows and take questions from the group!
