# December 16th 2022 - Tackle tough ticket triage troubles and flatten funkily formatted lists

As always, we get an update from our fearless Dev Team leader and CTO Nick who talks about new bulk selection/deletion options and developments on upcoming tagging functionality.

Then we hear from Tim to show us how to flatten pesky nested lists in Jinja with the new flatten functionality.

After that, making his ROC call debut, we have Matt walking through a ticket consolidation workflow to group related tickets during outages.

Finally, we take some questions from the group around upcoming ROC/Dev work and general queries!
