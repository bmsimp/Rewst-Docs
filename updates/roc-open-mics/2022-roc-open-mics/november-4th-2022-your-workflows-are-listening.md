# November 4th 2022 - Your Workflows are Listening ðŸ‘€

The Team talks through our new workflow listening functionality which allows you to trigger a workflow from another workflow completing. This should open up a lot of possibilities for existing workflows like user onboarding and offboarding or allow you to notify yourself when a workflow succeeds/fails.

Tim did a quick walkthrough of some new documentations and talking through lists in Jinja. We finished off with a client demo of a workflow that helps with onboarding new MSP clients into Rewst.

Lastly, we took some feedback on what folks wanted to see next week and answered a few questions!
