# October 28th 2022 - ImmyBot & User Offboarding

In this call, we're going to talk about two new crates that we have added to the Marketplace in the form of onboarding/offboarding computers via Immy and installing ad-hoc software.

We've also got a preview of the User Offboarding/Terminator workflow and form!

Finally, we'll finish with a Live Q\&A about all the things you want to know!
