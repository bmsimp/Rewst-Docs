# November 18th 2022 - Jinja Conditions in Templates / Scripts

Firstly, hear Aharon talk about our latest exciting news around our Series A funding!

The team runs through how to utilise Jinja within scripts and templates to define how an e-mail may look, or the route a script can take based on the Jinja

This can be used to pass dynamic variables into your script and, for example, only show "Group Names" as a header if there are groups defined.

We then have a demo from Ryan at Dev-Source on how they are utilising the Microsoft Graph APIs to determine MFA status across their estate - and document that!

Lastly, we took some feedback on what folks wanted to see next week and answered a few questions!
