# July 1st 2022 - Leaping and Looping through your data

In this call we are going to leap and loop (ðŸ˜Ž) through our data and talk about Jinja loops with our Crate Master Tim!

We've also got some new Crate Marketplace additions such as Just-In-Time Access for your techs for your on-prem servers.

And in this fully packed Open Mic, we're also going to hear from actual Rewst users with some real use-case automations.
