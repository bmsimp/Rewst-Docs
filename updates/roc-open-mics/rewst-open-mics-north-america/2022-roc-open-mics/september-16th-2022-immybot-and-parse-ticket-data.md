# September 16th 2022 - Immybot & Parse ticket data

In this call, we're going to talk about our new Immybot integration and run through CW Pods with clients

We'll also talk about how to use regex to parse through ticket descrptions to identify what the ticket is about and kick off workflows as a result.

Finally, we'll finish with a Live Q\&A about all the things you want to know!
