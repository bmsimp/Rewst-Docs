This week Nick starts us off with an update from the Dev Team and what's been released this week, focusing on some bug bashing and giving an update on the upcoming Auvik integration. Next, Tim from the ROC Team demos some of the finer details of triggers and how to leverage a few tips and tricks in your workflows.

We cut things a bit shorter this week by finishing off with a few questions from the group and then letting everyone go early to get to their weekend! Tune in next week for more robotic process rambunctiousness Rewst.
