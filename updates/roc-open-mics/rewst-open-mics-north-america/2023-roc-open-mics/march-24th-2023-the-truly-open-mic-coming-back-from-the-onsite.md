The team has returned from an awesome onsite where plans were made and bonds were forged. Brandon gives a quick update on upcoming Cluck-U courses, and then we dive right into talking about Microsoft Loop.

Next, we go free form and talk about different topics like dynamically filling out form fields and a Crate to install software with ImmyBot, and search results updates from Danial. Danial then hints at rumors of things that happened at the onsite, but then we moved on to Organization tags.

Next Ted shows off a workflow using an AI helper to get feedback on it and Tim jumps in to show some Jinja examples.

Next, Mendy shows off a single-action workflow where he uses with-items to iterate through org variables and retain information by splitting out variables. The next steps will be to store these in Halo or a DB.

To finish off, Ted jumps in and asks about sharing workflows and syncing workflows across different organizations!
