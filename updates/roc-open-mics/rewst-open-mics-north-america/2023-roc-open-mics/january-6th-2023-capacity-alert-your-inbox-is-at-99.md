As always, we get an update from our fearless Dev Team leader and CTO Nick who talks about a TON of new features and updates that are coming to the platform.

In todays Open Mic on the ROC side, we talk about the new mailbox quota feature and how to use it to alert on mailboxes that are over a certain threshold.

We also look at a workflow to deal with a common issue of closing tickets when an agent comes back online from the RMM

Finally, we take some questions from the group around upcoming ROC/Dev work and general queries!
