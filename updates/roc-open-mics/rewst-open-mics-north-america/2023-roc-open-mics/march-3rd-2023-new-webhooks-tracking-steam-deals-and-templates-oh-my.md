As usual, Nick takes us through some new functionality from the Dev Team starting with showing off some new webhook functionality in the form of a Rewsty Bot that you can ask questions to.

Next we hear from Jareth on the power of Rewst outside of just MSP applications as he takes us through his workflow that uses public APIs to check for Steam deals. After that Tim shows off a great example of templates.

After that we hear from Mendy at Rising Tide Consulting Group on how he's used HTML templates and Rewst forms to embed our forms into Halo PSA's customer facing portal. Finally, we answer a number of your questions!

See you next week!
