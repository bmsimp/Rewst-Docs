Nick kicks us off talking about all things Dev within the product, covering a few new features and bug fixes. Most notable is a fix to the "with items" logic that was causing a few hangups last week as well as improving on our architecture to improve performance within the platform!

Next, Brandon takes us through some awesome updates to our documentation site around brand new getting started resources within the platform! After that, we go through a few demos in the product from Rewst customers and employees alike!

First, one of our power users, Mendy, shows off a message tracking workflow he built in Rewst for Halo PSA to show information about emails and whether they've been opened or moved around within a users inbox.

Next, our extremely handsome CSM Jesse (who definitely did not write this description) shows off a workflow listener that lets you send an email after a workflow runs using the new employee workflow as an example.

Finally, another power user, Brandon, shows how to trigger workflows via URL parameters and access the information in the workflow. To finish off we take questions and comments from the group!
