Starting off in usual fashion, Nick takes us through the developments from the Development Team showing off the new "snap to grid" feature, some updated trigger functionality and the new SonicWall integration.

Next Crate Master Tim takes us through how to set up workflow listeners to run additional actions after your workflows have completed.

Building on Nick showing off the SonicWall integration, Brandon from our CX Team shows some new documentation for the SonicWall and Auvik integration as well as gives an update on courses and learning with Rewst.

Finally, Ashley from our CX Team makes her workflow debut to show off a workflow that will create Discord users and channels for our new customers.

As always we take questions and comments from the group to finish off!
