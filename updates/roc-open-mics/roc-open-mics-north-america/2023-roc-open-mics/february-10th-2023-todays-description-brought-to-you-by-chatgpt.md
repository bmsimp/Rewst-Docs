Allen from the Dev Team started off with a recap of what's new in the platform this week, covering the new Azure integration, await results from webhooks and a few other quality of life items. He demo's the new functionality for favouriting actions to help builders save time finding their favourite actions and getting them into their workflows. We also hear from Willis from our Dev Team shows off our OpenAI integration demoing an example use case of feeding a prompt through the integration to create an AI generated image.

Next Brent from Cloud-Cover shows off a workflow he built to complete Exchange actions through a form rather than requiring technicians to use powershell to complete those actions. Then he goes through another workflow to check through users who have been inactive for a certain time period to ensure they're not paying for unneeded licenses.

Our final demo for the week comes from Matthew at Expedient who created a PTO workflow for matching CW Manage and Outlook calendars for employees submitting out of office requests.

As always we finish off with questions and comments from the group!
