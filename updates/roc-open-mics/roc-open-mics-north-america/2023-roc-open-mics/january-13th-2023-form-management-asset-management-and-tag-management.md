# January 13th 2023 - Form Management, Asset Management and Tag Management

This call is for people who are:

* Interested in building their own workflows
* Wanting to stay on top of new developments
* Want to learn more about Rewst and participate in the community
* We will talk about the platform, news, some training, and any Q\&A.
* As always, feel free to unmute and interrupt us, this is an interactive call!

On this ROC call, Tim kicks us off by reviewing a workflow that lets you send form URLs straight to tickets in CW Manage.

Afterwards, Terry from the ROC Team demos a workflow that assigns the last logged in user to an asset in Autotask.

Next, our CTO Nick walks through what's new from the Development Team and gives us an in depth look at the upcoming tagging system for workflows.

We finish off with a few discussions around upcoming integrations and using Microsoft Teams with Rewst.
