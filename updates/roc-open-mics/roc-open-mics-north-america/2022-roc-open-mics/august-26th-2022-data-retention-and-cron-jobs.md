# August 26th 2022 - Data retention & Cron Jobs

In this call, we're going to talk about our latest feature around data retention within Rewst and how you can configure results to be removed after x number of days

We're also going to talk about some new triggers, including our new Cron Job trigger so you can run workflows at the same time, on your own schedule.

Finally, we'll finish with a Live Q\&A about all the things you want to know!
