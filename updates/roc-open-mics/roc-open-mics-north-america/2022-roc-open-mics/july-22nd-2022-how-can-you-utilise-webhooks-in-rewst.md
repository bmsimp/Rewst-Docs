# July 22nd 2022 - How can you utilise webhooks in Rewst?

In this call, we're going to have a quick refresh on the platform to understand some of the recent changes both in navigation and on the backend.

We're also going to look at how you can use webhooks as both triggers for workflows, and how to use them in the workflows themselves to send/retrieve data from various platforms.

Finally, we'll finish with a Live Q\&A about all the things you want to know!

<summary><strong>Learning Topic</strong></summary>

*   HTTP Request

    * https://swapi.dev/api/planets
    * Grab results and paste into Live Editor. Example snippets:
    * \{{ \[ planet for planet in CTX.data.results ] \}}
    * \{{ \[ planet.name for planet in CTX.data.results ] \}}
    * \{{ \[ {"name":planet.name,"year\_length":planet.orbital\_period} for planet in CTX.data.results ] \}}
    *

    \{{ year\_data | sort(attribute="year\_length") \}}
* Dynamic Webhooks
  * Core -> Create Webhook
    * When this action runs, it creates an HTTP Listener (web site basically) at a random URL
      * URL is one-time use only
      * Once it is hit once, it disappears
    * Output items:
      * url URL of the webhook
      * webhook\_id\` Used for the _Await Webhook Request_ action
    * GET Webhook - Response Body ( curl the RESULT.result.url )
    * POST Webhook
      * Use _Await Webhook Request_ to receive the input
        * Webhook ID: \{{ TASKS.core\_create\_webhook.result.result.webhook\_id \}}
        * curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"foo": \[4,8,15,16,23,42]}' $URL
        * We use this in scripts to get output from endpoints when we run commands via RMM
