# July 29th 2022 - How do you know that the person on the phone is who they say?

In this call, we're going to have a quick refresh on the platform to understand some of the recent changes both in navigation and on the backend.

We're also going to look at how you can control who authorises certain actions on your service desk. For instance if you have a new tech, or an older tech with bad habits where they recognise a voice and authorise based on that, how do you force authorisation regardless without causing more work for your tech?

Finally, we'll finish with a Live Q\&A about all the things you want to know!
