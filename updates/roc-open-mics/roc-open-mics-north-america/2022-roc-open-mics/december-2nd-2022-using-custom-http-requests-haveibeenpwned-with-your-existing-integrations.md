# December 2nd 2022 - Using custom HTTP requests (HaveIBeenPwned) with your existing integrations

Firstly, hear Nick our CTO talk about a TON of new features and performance improvements across the platform.

We talk about how to utilise custom HTTP requests to utilise the likes of HaveIBeenPwned and identify breaches for your customers

We then show how to loop through these M365 users, check for breaches and then log tickets with those breaches.

Lastly, we took some feedback on what folks wanted to see next week and answered a few questions!
