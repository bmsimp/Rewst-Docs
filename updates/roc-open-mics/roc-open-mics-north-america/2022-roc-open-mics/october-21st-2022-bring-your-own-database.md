# October 21st 2022 - Bring! Your! Own! Database!

The Rewst Dev Team takes over for the start of this ROC call to show off the much anticipated database integration with PostgreSQL, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server. In the second half of the call we cover new trigger criteria and review how to remediate issues with transitions between actions in a workflow.

We finish off with a customer workflow demo for backup alerting and remediation.

As always, we answer any questions that come up throughout the call!
