# July 8th 2022 - New ways to deal with data and client example workflows!

In this call, we're going to see a number of example workflows - but not ones we have made, ones that our clients have come up with and either created themselves or created with the help of the ROC team!

Understand how others are using the platform and maybe get some inspiration for your own automation workflow ideas!
