# Sign up to present at any Open Mic

## How volunteering works

Sign up via our [interest form](https://app.rewst.io/organizations/40f8b55a-e8a9-42fc-8dc1-179616275f10/form/c0838ef0-9685-4ab9-ac53-37979df75733?triggerId=c0838ef0-9685-4ab9-ac53-37979df75733) to let us know that you'd like to present. Someone on the Rewst team will reach out about scheduling demos.&#x20;

On your scheduled day, attend the Open Mic, and wait for us to introduce you and hand over presenting duties. Presenting on Open Mic calls is an opportunity to inform, engage, and inspire our customers. By following these best practices, we can ensure every session is clear, valuable, and enjoyable for all attendees. Let’s make every presentation count!

## Presenting at Open Mic? You've got this.

### Tips to help you feel confident and make an impact

Every Open Mic is a chance to show how you're using Rewst to solve real-world problems—and inspire others while you're at it. We've put together a few friendly tips to help you feel prepped and confident, whether it’s your first time or fiftieth.

* Think of it as a story, not a script. Tell us what you built, why it matters, and how it helps.
* Use your voice. You know your work best—share it like you're showing a teammate.
* Keep it casual. Nobody’s expecting a TED Talk—just your real experience.
* Got a hiccup? No biggie. We’ve all been there. Your insights are what matter most.

### **How to rock your Rewst Open Mic presentation without the pressure**

Open Mic at Rewst is all about real partners showing real solutions. There’s no pressure to be perfect; just be real. If you’re thinking about presenting, or already signed up, this guide will help you feel ready and relaxed.

### What to know before you present

* This is your story. You're showing something you made—so tell us why you built it, what problem it solved, and how it’s working out.
* Keep it light, keep it human. No need for a rehearsed speech. Talk us through it like you would a coworker who asked, “Hey, what are you working on?”
* If it breaks, that's okay. We're all building. If a demo hits a snag, talk through what it _should_ do. That’s just as valuable.

### **A simple flow that works**

Use this structure to keep things on track without overthinking it.

1. What is it? Describe what you built and where the idea came from.
2. Why does it matter? Briefly explain the value to your team or customers.
3. How does it work? Give a live walkthrough or screen share the process.
4. What's next? Share any ideas you have for improvements or related builds.

### Presentation tips that empower

* Trust your process. You built this—you know it better than anyone.
* Speak like you’re talking to a teammate. Avoid jargon, unless you explain it.
* Keep it tight. A 5-10 minute demo is perfect. Think highlight reel, not full feature tour.
* Engage a little. Ask a question, invite feedback, or just share what excited you most.

### **Quick reminders**

We want to make sure your presentation is safe and respectful of others. So, please avoid:

* Sharing sensitive info - e.g., organization names, API keys, private dashboards
* Going way off-topic - keep the focus on what brings value to our Rewst community

### **A note on privacy and responsibility**

We trust our presenters to use discretion and only share what’s appropriate for public calls. Rewst does not assume responsibility for any sensitive or proprietary information shared during Open Mic sessions.

### **After you present**

* Wrap with confidence. End by recapping what you shared and what’s next.
* Let us know when you're done. A clear finish helps us move smoothly to the next presenter.
* Stick around! Stay to hear from others and join the conversation.
