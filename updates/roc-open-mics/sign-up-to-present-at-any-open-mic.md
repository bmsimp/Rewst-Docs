By following these best practices, we can ensure every session is clear, valuable, and enjoyable for all attendees. Letâ€™s make every presentation count!

## Best practices for presenting on Open Mics

Open Mic calls are a key opportunity to show off how you use Rewst to save time and deliver results. To ensure every presentation is clear, engaging, and impactful, follow these best practices.

### **1. Preparation is key**

âœ… **Know your content** â€“ Outline what you'll present and rehearse your key talking points.

âœ… **Have a clear structure**

Follow a simple format:

* **What is it?** Describe how you came to your idea, and how it's built.
* **Why it matters?** Explain business value and user benefits.
* **How it works?** Live demo or walkthrough your creation.
* **Whatâ€™s next?** Suggest future improvements or related uses.

âœ… **Test your demo** â€“ Ensure everything works smoothly beforehand to avoid technical issues.

### **2. Delivery and engagement**

âœ… **Be energetic and enthusiastic** â€“ Your tone sets the mood. Show excitement for what youâ€™re presenting!

âœ… **Use simple, relatable language** â€“ Speak as if youâ€™re explaining to a colleague, avoiding unnecessary jargon.

âœ… **Engage with the audience** â€“ Ask at least one question, prompt reactions, or invite feedback.

ðŸš« **Donâ€™t read directly from a script** â€“ Use bullet points or notes, but keep it conversational.

ðŸš« **Donâ€™t ramble or go off-topic** â€“ Stick to whatâ€™s relevant and valuable to our partners, and try to stick to your allotted time.

ðŸš« **Don't share sensitive information** like the Organization Picker, Customer Names, or proprietary data like API keys, etc.

### **3. Effective demos**

âœ… **Highlight key features** â€“ Show whatâ€™s most important, not every single detail.

âœ… **Explain the why and frame the context** â€“Explain the problem the update solves before jumping into the solution.

âœ… **Use real-world examples** â€“ Show how a user would actually benefit from the update.

âœ… **Keep it concise** â€“ A focused 3-5 minute demo is more effective than a long, unfocused walkthrough.

ðŸš« **Donâ€™t click randomly through screens** â€“ Have a plan.

ðŸš« **Donâ€™t assume prior knowledge** â€“ Always assume brand new users are in the audience - cater to them.

### **4. Close strong**

âœ… **Summarize key takeaways** â€“ Reinforce the main points in one or two sentences.

âœ… **Encourage engagement** â€“ Ask for questions or invite follow-up discussions.

âœ… **Express excitement** â€“ End on a high note with enthusiasm for whatâ€™s coming next.

ðŸš« **Let us know when you're done** â€“ Wrap up with a strong, confident closing statement.
