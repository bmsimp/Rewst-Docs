Nick kicks us off with an update from the Development Team including two terrific technical trigger tutorials covering the new trigger criteria tester and jinja evaluations in trigger critera filtering.

Tim solidifies the trigger criteria testing feature with a demo using incoming info from the OpenAI API and filtering the results.

For our first customer demo, Brandon from eTop Technology shows off how he uses prebuilt workflows (created by yourself or the ROC) as single actions to simplify the process of building a new workflow using powershell scripts.

Brandon continues to shine by walking through the steps of our "Run Powershell on Org Domain Controller" workflow in place of the Roc! Then he walks through a help form and workflow that they use.

Finally, the Roc works through some additional customer questions from the kewp (insert plug here to join the kewp in Discord and ask questions)!
