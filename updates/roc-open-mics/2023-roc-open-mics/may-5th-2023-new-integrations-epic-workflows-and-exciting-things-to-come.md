In this call, we cover the following:

* Development updates on bug fixes/improvements including improved action bar search functionality, fixed infinite loops in Jinja, added tooltips for trigger criteria, fixed workflow cancel button, fixed form bug where hidden fields will display, and fixed a Microsoft EXO NewMail-Contact bug.
* Next, Nick covered some items in testing and QA, as well as new features, including Multitenancy integrations, turned on for all integrations with the exception of a few, an Acronis integration, an update to the Crate Marketplace including styles and formatting, and finally a favorites menu in the Action bar.
* Next, Brandon covers some Cluck U and Docs updates including new Acronis Integration Documentation and written hands-on exercises steps for Rewst 103 and 104 on rewst.help.
* Next up, the incredible Ashley Cooper shows off a workflow using the Auvik Integration that gets the device information and serves it up using a combination of Jinja, Rewst styles, and HTML! The output is a page that shows all the devices in Auvik, which tenant they belong to, and other information on an HTML page that links to Auvik. Tim then jumps in to provide some more information.
* Nick hints at a special incoming feature? How exciting!
* Next, Brandon from eTop shows off a workflow that gets feedback from each action. He starts with the power of transitions and then moves on to his implementation where his workflow provides just-in-time access for local admin accounts in ConnectWise Manage.
* Finally, Tim shows off the On-Prem Run Powershell on Org Domain Controller sub-workflow that's available for anyone to use in a workflow! â€‹
