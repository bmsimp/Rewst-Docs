This week Aharon is returning from Right of Boom at warp speed. NC20 Human Automation relations and his counterparts R0C2 and Shay from the Matrix show off the Auvik Integration, Workflow Demos, and a Crate demo! NickC20 starts us off with an update from the Dev Team and what's been released this week, announcing the Auvik integration, available today, as well as some bug fixes and what's in testing and development.

Next, our Dev team shows off the Auvik integration and then some ROC members show off some awesome workflows you won't want to miss. Then Shay from the Matrix shows up to show off a Create example? How many sci-fi references can we make in this description?

Tune in next time for \[insert sci-fi reference here]!
