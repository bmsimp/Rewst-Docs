<summary><strong>Bug fixes and chores</strong></summary>

* Detailed MFA Reporting
  * In multiple data aliases, added jinja checks to make sure the response object exists.
  * Added boolean input of `no_reporting` and outputs of `success` and `per_user_data`(list) to make crate workflow useable as subworkflow.
* User Offboard V2
  * Accounted for form output indicating that it was unable to retrieve users for entra when running onprem only.
* GWS: User Onboard / Offboard
  * Fixed bad references causing time to always evaluate as UTC now (and never delay).
  * Made references match the inputs. Removed timezone conversions on delay\_time and check\_delay aliases.
  * Made new alias to create a vanity DT object to feed into ticketing with the timezone.
* New Employee Onboarding
  * Updated options generator for list subscribed products to include `Microsoft_Teams_Enterprise_New` which is no longer included in the Microsoft sku CSV.
  * Updated the license lookup JSON template for the license assignment workflow to include more skus
