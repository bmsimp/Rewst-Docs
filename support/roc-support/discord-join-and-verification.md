# Discord join & verification

## Discord verification process

To streamline your onboarding experience, we've implemented a new verification process for joining and interacting with our Discord servers. Whether you're new to our community or already a member, follow the steps below to get set up quickly and easily.

{% hint style="warning" %}
During the Discord verification process, we temporarily ask for access to "Join servers on your behalf" - this is done using the User API Token generated during the process.\
\
We do not store this token.
{% endhint %}
