# Create a ticket via Discord

### Creating a Ticket via Discord

When you encounter an issue that needs our attention, creating a ticket is a straightforward process. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Right-click the message** that pertains to the issue you're experiencing.
2. A menu will appear. Look for the option to **"Create Support Ticket"** under Apps and click on it.
3. You'll be presented with some information to confirm the information for the ticket you will be submitting.
   * Note - If you see a Warning stating that the author of the message is not verified, the author should follow our verification steps [as outlined here](../roc-support/discord-join-and-verification.md).
4. Select the **"Submit Ticket"** button and this will start the ticket creation process. 
5. This will then create a thread within your channel to allow for easier communication on that specific issue.

Our ROC team will then review the ticket and get back to you based on the [priority level of your issue.](support-priorities.md)
