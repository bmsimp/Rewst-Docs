# Create a ticket via Discord

### Create a ticket&#x20;

When you encounter an issue that needs our attention, creating a ticket is a straightforward process. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Right-click the message** that pertains to the issue you're experiencing.
2. A menu will appear. Click **Create Support Ticket** under **Apps**.
3. You'll be presented with some information to confirm the information for the ticket you will be submitting.
   * Note - If you see a warning stating that the author of the message is not verified, the author should follow our verification steps [as outlined here](discord-join-and-verification.md).
4. Click **Submit Ticket**. This will start the ticket creation process.
5. This will then create a thread within your channel to allow for easier communication on that specific issue.

Our support team will then review the ticket and get back to you based on the [priority level of your issue.](support-priorities.md)

### When to create a support ticket

If you're unsure whether your issue warrants creating a ticket or not, we've got you covered. Please refer to our [Support Priorities page](./) for guidance on when to log a ticket versus having a discussion in your channel.

Remember, if you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to a member of the support team. [We're here to help!](../contact-resources.md)
