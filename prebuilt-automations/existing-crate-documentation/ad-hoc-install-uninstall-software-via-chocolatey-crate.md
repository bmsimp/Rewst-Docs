## What does the Ad-Hoc Install/Uninstall Software via Chocolatey Crate do?

Our Ad-Hoc Install/Uninstall Software via Chocolatey Crate enables technicians to manage software installations directly from PSA tickets. It connects your PSA system with Chocolatey package management, allowing you to remotely install or uninstall software packages on specific client devices without manual intervention.

This Crate focuses on simplifying common software management tasks, but doesn't handle complex configuration management or application settings. You can extend its functionality by connecting it to other automation workflows in Rewst.

* Remove unauthorized or problematic software from client devices
* Deploy standard software packages across client environments
* Maintain accurate software inventory by logging all changes in PSA tickets
