## What does the Change a User’s Password Crate do?

Our Change a User’s Password Crate uses a form-driven submission to change a user’s password in any environment: on-prem, hybrid, or Entra. Select an existing ticket, or a new one will be created to document the change. Select a generated password, or enter one manually.

### Why use the Change a User’s Password Crate?

* Efficiently change a user’s password
* Consistently document the change

## Crate prerequisites

* [PSA integration](../../documentation/integrations/individual-integration-documentation/psa/) must be set up
* [RMM integration](../../documentation/integrations/individual-integration-documentation/rmm/) must be set up
* default\_psa org variable set
* default\_rmm org variable set

4.  Ensure that you have the required org variables setup for the Crate. Ready org variables will have a checkmark next to them under the Required Org Variables section, as seen in the screenshot below. An org variable without a check mark [will still need to be set up](../../documentation/user-management/organization-variables.md) before proceeding with unpacking the Crate. When confirmed, click Unpack Crate.\
