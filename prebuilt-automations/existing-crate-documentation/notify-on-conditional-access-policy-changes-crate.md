## What does the Notify on Conditional Access Policy Changes Crate do?

This Crate monitors Microsoft 365 Conditional Access Policy changes and generates notifications via ticket creation and email alerts. It leverages OpenAI to provide a clearer, human-readable summary of policy modifications.

9. Click **Unpack**.

### How the Crate triggers

This Crate can be triggered in two ways.

#### **Cron job trigger**

* The Cron Trigger schedules periodic checks for Conditional Access policy changes.
* Configured using UTC cron expressions (default: `/42 * * * *`).

#### **New directory audit log: Policy trigger**

* Monitors Microsoft Entra ID audit logs
* Fires when a Conditional Access policy is modified
* Checks for events where:
  * `trigger.loggedByService == "Conditional Access"`
  * `trigger.targetResources.0.type == "Policy"`

### Optional: Use OpenAI for enhanced insights&#x20;

The **OpenAI integration** can be used for enhanced notifications by analyzing policy changes and summarizing them in a clear, human-readable format. This helps administrators quickly understand:

* What changes were made.
* Who initiated the changes.
* Whether the changes introduce potential security risks.
* Recommendations on whether further investigation is needed.

When OpenAI is enabled — `vars.use_openai = "yes"` — notifications will include AI-generated insights to provide contextual explanations of the modifications.

### Data included in notifications

Each notification, whether email or ticket, includes:

* **Policy Name** – The name of the modified Conditional Access policy.
* **Change Type** – Whether the policy was added, removed, or updated.
* **Modified By** – The identity of the user or system that made the change.
* **Timestamp** – When the change was detected.
* **Summary of Changes** – A structured breakdown of what was altered in the policy.
* **OpenAI Analysis, if enabled** – AI-generated interpretation of the change's impact.
