## **What does the Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate do?**

The Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate automates the user onboarding process by streamlining account creation, group assignments, licensing, and additional configurations across Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD, and on-premises Active Directory.

Ensure that new employees or contractors are provisioned accurately and consistently based on predefined policies, integrating seamlessly with PSA, RMM, documentation, and licensing systems.

* License and group management: Assigns Microsoft 365 licenses, security groups, and shared mailboxes

* [Documentation Integrations](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/documentation) must be set up if you wish to create documentation in your knowledge base. This is optional.
* [Licensing integrations](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/licensing) should be completed if you wish to set up automated license purchases. Configure Pax8, Ingram Micro, Sherweb, or Synnex. This is optional.

## Migration guide: Moving from a previous onboarding Crate

{% hint style="warning" %}
☝️If you’re using a previous version of the onboarding workflow, follow these migration steps to transition to the new version. If this is your first time using this Crate, this information isn't relevant to you.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Crate migration steps</summary>

1. Unpack the new Crate in your environment.
2. Test the setup to verify that your organizational variables are correctly configured.
   * The same org variables are used as in the previous version.
   * If updates are required, refer to the [Organizational Variables Guide](https://www.notion.so/Draft-Microsoft-User-Onboarding-Crate-Part-1-19fb56f9907180118ca4c28be86cda8a?pvs=21).
3. Once testing is complete, transition to the new workflow:
   * If using the new form:
     * Disable form triggers in the previous onboarding workflow.
     * Update internal documentation with the new form URL.
     * If necessary, provide customers with the new onboarding form link.
   * If keeping the previous form linked:
     * The previous form can be linked to this version, but will not receive future updates.
     * Rewst will only maintain this version moving forward.
