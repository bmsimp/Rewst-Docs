# Expanded features and customizing the Onboarding Crate

## **Approval requirement for new users**

By default, the Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate provisions users immediately upon form submission. However, some organizations may require an approval process before onboarding users.

### **How the approval workflow works**

1. The user submits the onboarding form.
2. The workflow pauses execution and notifies the designated approver—IT admin, HR, or supervisor.
3. The approver receives a notification via email, PSA ticket, or within Rewst.
4. If approved, the workflow proceeds with user creation.
5. If denied, the workflow terminates without creating the user.

### **How to enable the approval workflow**

Configure the following **organizational variable** in **Rewst > Configuration > Organizational Variables**:

| **Variable name**                | **Purpose**                                              | **Default value** |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `require_approval_for_new_users` | Enables the approval step before user creation.          | `0` Disabled      |
| `new_user_approval_email`        | Defines the email address for sending approval requests. | None              |

{% hint style="warning" %}
If approvals are enabled, ensure that designated approvers regularly check for pending requests.
{% endhint %}

## **Ticketing and documentation handling**

The Crate automatically creates and updates tickets in supported PSA platforms.

### **Automated PSA ticket creation and management**

| **Functionality**                | **Description**                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create Ticket if None Exists** | A ticket is automatically created if one is not found.            |
| **Update Existing Ticket**       | If a ticket exists, it is updated with onboarding progress.       |
| **Track Onboarding Status**      | The ticket logs user details, licensing, and provisioning status. |
| **Define Ticket Prioritization** | Rewst assigns default priorities, work roles, and tech IDs.       |

### **Ticketing organizational variables**

| **Variable name**                 | **Purpose**                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default_psa`                     | Selects the PSA where tickets will be created.                   |
| `default_ticket_location`         | Defines the board for Rewst-created tickets.                     |
| `default_ticket_status`           | The ticket status when Rewst is actively processing.             |
| `ticket_status_waiting_input`     | The status when waiting for manual input-e.g., license purchase. |
| `ticket_status_workflow_complete` | The status when the onboarding workflow is completed.            |
| `default_priority`                | Assigns the default priority for onboarding tickets.             |
| `send_from_address`               | The reply-to address for emails sent from Rewst.                 |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that PSA permissions allow Rewst to create and modify tickets.
{% endhint %}

## **Delayed user creation**

The onboarding process can be scheduled for a future date instead of immediate provisioning.

### **How it works**

1. The **Start Date** field is set in the onboarding form.
2. The workflow pauses execution until the specified date.
3. On the activation date, the workflow automatically resumes and creates the user.

### **Enable delayed user creation**

This setting is useful when onboarding users before their official start date.

| **Variable name**               | **Purpose**                        | **Default value** |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `allow_scheduled_user_creation` | Enables scheduled user activation. | `0` (Disabled)    |

## **Multi-Factor Authentication enrollment**

The Crate does not enforce MFA directly but supports Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) conditional access policies.

### **Recommended MFA configuration**

1. Enable Azure AD Security Defaults to enforce MFA at the tenant level.
2. Use Conditional Access Policies to require MFA for new users.
3. Set up self-service MFA registration to allow users to enroll their devices.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that MFA policies align with company security requirements before enforcing them.
{% endhint %}

## **Security and password management**

The Crate includes flexible password handling options based on security policies.

## **Licensing and group assignments**

The Crate supports multiple licensing and group assignment methods.

### **License assignment options**

| **Method**                   | **Description**                                             |

| **Direct Assignment**        | The user is assigned an M365 license individually.          |
| **License Group Membership** | The user is added to an M365 license group.                 |
| **Auto-Purchase Licenses**   | If no licenses are available, Rewst can purchase new seats. |

To enable license auto-purchasing, configure the following setting:

| **Variable name**                         | **Purpose**                                | **Default value** |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `auto_purchase_license_if_none_available` | Enables license auto-purchase when needed. | ✅ Enabled         |

## Manual license purchase process

### **When is the manual license purchase process triggered?**

This process is triggered under the following conditions:

* The organization is not mapped to a distributor such as Pax8, Sherweb, Ingram Micro, etc., preventing automatic license purchasing.
* The user has selected manual purchase in the onboarding form or the workflow logic determines that auto-purchase is unavailable.
* There are no available licenses, and auto-purchasing is disabled in Rewst organizational settings.

### **Process flow**

{% hint style="info" %}
Expand each of the steps below to see the related part of the process flow.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>1. Adding a note to the PSA ticket</summary>



* When a manual license purchase is required, the workflow adds an internal note to the PSA ticket.

- This note informs the technician that a license is needed and provides action URLs to confirm purchase or reject purchase.

*   The message added to the ticket is as follows:

    > `The organization Name requires a license and either you have selected to purchase the license manually or the organization is not mapped with the distributor.`
    >
    > `Please purchase the requested license and once complete, click the URL below. Note the window will close automatically:`
    >
    > **`Confirm License Purchase: Link`**
    >
    > `If you don't want to purchase the license right now, click the URL below. You will need to manually apply a license to the user after the workflow is complete:`
    >
    > \*\*`Reject License Purchase:** **Link**`

- The workflow pauses execution until one of these actions is taken.

</details>

<details>

<summary>2. Technician decision : Confirm or reject license purchase</summary>



The technician has two options:

**Option 1: Confirm license purchase**

* The technician clicks the **Confirm License Purchase** URL.
* This triggers a webhook **response** that allows the workflow to continue.
* The following actions occur:
  * A **ticket note is added** stating that the license has been purchased manually.
  * The workflow resumes and attempts to **assign the purchased license to the user**.
  * The workflow continues to the **next step in the onboarding process**.

**Option 2: Reject license purchase**

* The technician clicks the **Reject License Purchase** URL.
* This triggers a **webhook response** indicating that the purchase was not completed.
* The following actions occur:
  * A ticket note is added stating that the license was not purchased.
  * The workflow continues without assigning a license. The technician must assign the license manually at a later stage.

</details>

<details>

<summary>3. Handling timeouts: No action taken</summary>



* If **neither Confirm** nor **Reject** is selected within 24 hours, the workflow automatically adds a timeout note to the PSA ticket.

-   The message added to the ticket is:

    `No option was chosen to purchase the license, and the request has now timed out.`

* The workflow proceeds without assigning a license, requiring manual intervention later.

</details>

| Add PSA Note                         | Adds a note to the PSA ticket requesting manual license purchase confirmation. | Technician receives instructions to confirm or reject the purchase.                       |
| Technician Confirms License Purchase | Clicks **"Confirm License Purchase"** link.                                    | The workflow assigns the license and proceeds with onboarding.                            |
| Technician Rejects License Purchase  | Clicks **"Reject License Purchase"** link.                                     | The workflow proceeds **without assigning a license**, requiring manual assignment later. |
| Technician Takes No Action           | No response within **24 hours**.                                               | The workflow adds a timeout note and proceeds without assigning a license.                |

## **Organizational variables affecting this workflow**

| **ORG.VARIABLES**                         | **Purpose**                                                                    |   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - |
| `microsoft_licensing_distributor`         | Defines the distributor for license purchases (if auto-purchasing is enabled). |   |
| `auto_purchase_license_if_none_available` | Enables auto-purchase of licenses when none are available.                     |   |
| `default_psa`                             | Defines which PSA system to log ticket updates in.                             |   |
| `default_ticket_status`                   | Defines the PSA ticket status when waiting for technician input.               |   |
| `ticket_status_waiting_input`             | The status set in PSA when awaiting technician action.                         |   |

## **Final notes**

* The manual license process ensures that a technician has full control over licensing decisions when auto-purchasing is unavailable.
* Clear ticketing updates and automation logs ensure visibility into whether a license was purchased, rejected, or timed out.
* If manual licensing becomes a frequent issue, consider updating organizational variables to enable auto-purchasing where possible.

## **User name format and offboarding defaults**

### **Username format options**

The Crate allows you to standardize username formats for new accounts.
