# Testing and troubleshooting the Onboarding crate

## **Testing the Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate**

To verify that the Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate is functioning correctly, follow the testing steps below.

### **Step 1: Submit a test user through the onboarding form**

1. Navigate to **Automations > Forms**.
2. Search for `[Crate] Microsoft: User Onboarding` and open the form.
3. Enter **test user details**, ensuring all required fields are populated.
4. Choose **license assignment and security groups**.
5. Submit the form.

If the approval workflow is **enabled**, the request must be approved before provisioning proceeds.

### **Step 2: Validate workflow execution**

1. Go to **Automations > Results**.
2. Search for `Microsoft: User Onboarding`.
3. Open the latest execution result and verify that the workflow completed successfully.
4. Review the execution logs for any failed steps or warnings. If any failures occur, refer to the troubleshooting section below.

### **Step 3: Verify user creation and assignments**

| **Verification step**                           | **Expected outcome**                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Directory (On-Prem AD Only / Hybrid)** | User appears in **Active Directory Users & Computers (ADUC)**.   |
| **Azure AD (Cloud / Hybrid)**                   | User is created in **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**.            |
| **Security Groups**                             | User is assigned to **the selected security groups**.            |
| **Microsoft 365 Licensing**                     | License is assigned to the user (directly or via a group).       |
| **Shared Mailbox & Permissions**                | User has "Send As" or "Send on Behalf" permissions, if selected. |

If a user does not appear in AD or Azure AD, check the **workflow execution logs**.

### **Step 4: Confirm ticket and documentation updates**

| **Verification step**                 | **Expected outcome**                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PSA Ticket Creation**               | A new ticket is created in **ConnectWise, Autotask, Halo PSA, ServiceNow, etc.**. |
| **Ticket Updates**                    | The ticket logs **user details, group assignments, and licensing information**.   |
| **External Documentation (Optional)** | User credentials are stored in **ITGlue, Hudu, or Passportal**, if enabled.       |

<summary>Issue: Required fields in Halo preventing ticket creation or updates</summary>



#### Symptoms:

* Ticket creation or updates in Halo PSA fail unexpectedly.
* Errors appear related to missing mandatory fields when attempting to create or update a ticket.
* The default Halo PSA ruleset causes validation failures.

#### Possible causes:

* Mandatory fields are enabled in Halo PSA, preventing Rewst from creating or updating tickets.
* The default Halo PSA ruleset requires additional fields not configured in the workflow.
* The \[REWST - TASK] PSA-Halo PSA: Create Ticket action does not include the required mandatory field values.

#### **S**olution:

1. Remove mandatory fields from your PSA to allow for seamless automation.
2. Unsync your PSA-Halo Create Ticket Crate to manually modify field requirements:
   * Navigate to \[REWST - TASK] PSA-Halo PSA: Create Ticket.
   * In the halo\_create\_ticket action, ensure all mandatory fields have valid values.
3. Understand the impact of unsyncing a Crate:
   * By default, all Crates are synced when unpacked.
   * Unsyncing a Crate allows customization but requires manual maintenance.
   * We recommend using synced Crates until youâ€™ve completed Rewst training in Cluck University.
