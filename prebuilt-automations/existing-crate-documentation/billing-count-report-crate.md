## Test the Crate

To test this Crate, you'll need to adjust the cron trigger's schedule to a few minutes in the future, then adjust it back to your regular schedule after the test. Alternatively, you could wait until the regularly scheduled run occurs and check your result, which would not require you to update the cron trigger schedule.\


1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows**.
2. Search for `billing count` .
3. Click on the workflow to open it in the workflow builder.
4. Adjust the cron trigger's schedule to five minutes from your current time. The workflow will run on its own then. A ticket or email will be generated if the workflow is successful.
