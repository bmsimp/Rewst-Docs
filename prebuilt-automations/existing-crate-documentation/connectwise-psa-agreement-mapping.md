## What does the ConnectWise PSA Agreement Mapping Crate do?

Our ConnectWise PSA Agreement Mapping Crate synchronizes users into Connectwise PSA agreement additions by license, department, or group membership. This Crate allows a user to map user groupings to those agreements to facilitate automated billing reconciliation, based on a selection of criteria. Based on the user categorization, these can be mapped to existing additions in the agreements, to populate the **Quantity** field for those additions.

## Why use the ConnectWise PSA Agreement Mapping Crate?

* Add ConnectWise PSA Agreements
* Modify ConnectWise PSA Agreements
* Remove ConnectWise PSA Agreements
* Ensure ConnectWise PSA Agreements are accurate and up-to-date

From the MSP organization, use this form to **Add**, **Modify**, or **Remove** a mapping configuration. When adding or modifying a mapping, you'll make the following choices:

* **Customer**: This will be from the list of PSA clients
* **Agreement**: PSA Agreement which we will be mapping users to
* **Line Item**: Also known as the Agreement Addition, this is the item which will have its quantity determined by the collection process
* **Mapping Type**:
  * **Group**: Choose this to map users according to membership within an EntraAD Group
  * **License**: Use this to map the users according to a Microsoft 365 License that is applied to them
  * **Department**: This will use the **Department** field as it is filled in users' EntraAD properties
* Depending on the mapping type, you'll be presented with a field to choose from the options that are available in the specific customer's environment to map users by: **Group**, **License**, or **Department**.
* **Sync User Names into Description**: If you enable this, the actual names of the users will be put into the **Description** field of each addition.
* **Split User Names by**: This will allow you to choose between **Comma** and **New Line** to fine-tune how the list of users appears on the invoice. Commas will use fewer lines when you have many users, but new line may be easier to read.

## Limitations

* **Department** fields are free-form text. If you aren't automating the filling-in of these, there's always the chance that spellings or formatting may vary, resulting in incomplete data.
* The **Description** field in PSA Agreement Additions is limited to 6000 characters. Large sets of users can easily exceed that maximum and usernames won't appear in the Addition. When this happens, an email will be sent to the person who created the mapping to let them know that this is the case.&#x20;
