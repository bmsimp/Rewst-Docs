# User Offboarding V2 Crate

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re new to Crates, read through our introductory Crate documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/crates). The User Offboarding V2 Crate can be found in our Crate Marketplace.
{% endhint %}

## What does the User Offboarding V2 Crate do?

Our User Offboarding V2 Crate offers a robust logging system and greater flexibility than our original V1 of the Crate. It was designed with standardization and simplification in mind. Each of the workflow tasks and functions are contained within a subworkflow that contains a log message with the results and status of the subworkflow. This allows for easier troubleshooting, and even modification of the workflow.

## Why use the User Offboarding Crate?

* Offboard users that are in the following Active Directory configurations:
  * Azure Active Directory
  * On-premises
  * Hybrid Synced - Active Directory sync
  * Hybrid Not Synced - No Active Directory sync
* Increase time savings and decrease the potential for user error
* Maintain compliance and security standards
* Generate an audit trail by logging actions and their result within your PSA

{% endhint %}

### Required integrations:

* The [Microsoft Cloud integration bundle](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/cloud/-cloud-integration-bundle) must be set up. This enables Microsoft Graph API access for Azure AD and M365 deprovisioning.

### Optional integrations:

* For on-premises setup, you’ll need an [RMM integration](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/rmm) or [Agent Smith](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/agent-smith) to run commands against the domain controller.
* [PSA Integration](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/psa) must be setup. This is required for automated ticket creation and ticket updates.
* [Documentation Integrations](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/documentation) must be set up if you wish to create documentation in your knowledge base.

## Optional organization variables

| Variable                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The "Yes" option will add notes in the ticket we create when running an automation. The "No" option will let us impersonate a technician to apply time under there name for automations that run.

## Considerations when migrating between Crate versions

If you're considering migrating from V1 of this Crate to V2, follow the steps found on the page below:

{% content-ref url="../crates/migrating-between-crate-versions.md" %}
[migrating-between-crate-versions.md](../crates/migrating-between-crate-versions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Note: Rewst-managed workflows that contain the above functionality will automatically be updated when v1 is officially deprecated.
{% endhint %}

## How is this different from v1?

While there are numerous bug fixes and enhancements to V2, below is a list of the most requested changes.

* Improved ticketing functionality and control
* Support for the following Active Directory configurations:
  * Azure AD
  * On-premises (NEW)
  * Hybrid Synced (ENHANCED)
  * Hybrid Not Synced (ENHANCED)
* Ability to offboard email-only users when the primary identity provider is on-premises AD.
* New modular design that allows for rapid enhancements, fixes, and customizations.
* Expanded error handling allowing for task-specific logging
* Improved parallel action execution addressing bugs that prevented the use of workflow listeners.

## Troubleshoot the User Offboarding V2 Crate

Common issues include:

* Missing org variables can cause the workflow to fail or not work as expected.
* Missing trigger overrides can cause errors in the workflow.

Tips:

* This workflow contains a robust logging system, and can be checked for detailed information on sub-workflow success and data output. This can be used to diagnose issues in the workflow.
* The notes section of this workflow is one of its most powerful features. You can search the notes tab for functions such as `disable account` or `mailbox` and quickly be taken to that section of the workflow. This can be useful to find specific parts of the workflow that you want to adjust or view.
