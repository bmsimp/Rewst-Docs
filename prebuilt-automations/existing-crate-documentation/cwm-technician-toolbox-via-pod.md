# CWM: Technician Toolbox via Pod Crate

## What does the CWM: Technician Toolbox via Pod Crate do?

The Technical Toolbox Crate gives your technicians access to a wide range of tools, without the need to leave ConnectWise PSA's web-based service desk.

## Crate prerequisites&#x20;

## Unpack the Crate

1. Navigate to **Crates > Crate Marketplace** in the left side menu of the Rewst platform
2. Search for `CWM: Technician Toolbox Via Pod`_._\

## Use the tool box

On tickets with the pod running, you will see five main categories. Clicking the categories will open menu options for further tasks, as outlined below.&#x20;

## Re-run a pod from a ticket <a href="#re-running-a-pod-from-a-ticket" id="re-running-a-pod-from-a-ticket"></a>

Let's imagine that you have a ticket that has had its associated pod workflow execution expire or fail. If you attempt to view the pod in the ticket, you'll see something along the lines of:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 3.47.03 PM (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To execute a new instance of the pod, click the **Links** drop-down menu in the ticket. Choose **Rewst - Start Pod on this Ticket**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 3.47.15 PM.png" alt="" width="326"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After using this button, a web page will open and close. This will send a request to the live link trigger and start a new execution for that ticket. Allow some time to pass before the ticket updates. You should see the pod populate once the execution has gone through.
