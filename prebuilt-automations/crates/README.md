# What is a Crate?

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/KsrC5xjySds" %}

## **Introduction**

A **Crate** bundles workflows, forms, triggers, templates, scripts, and other essential components required for a specific function. These are usually built and curated by our ROC team or from our community to facilitate easy deployment. The area of your Rewst platform where all our Crates are listed is called the **Crate Marketplace**.

## **Unpacking a Crate**

1. **Access the Crate Marketplace:**
   * Log in to your Rewst Platform.
   *   Navigate to **Crates** > **Crate Marketplace**.\

2. **Select Your Crate:**
   * Browse through the marketplace to find your desired Crate, or use its direct link.
   * Click on the chosen Crate tile to view its details and requirements.
   * Search for Crates, **Sort By** different chosen parameters, and filter Crates by a variety of criteria, listed in the **Filter** drop down menu.
3. **Review and Adjust Settings:**
   * (Optional) Rename the workflow as per your preference.
   * Set or adjust any thresholds if available.
   * Choose relevant integrations or options.
4. **Manage Triggers:**
   * You might encounter a screen prompting you to enable or disable specific triggers.&#x20;
   * Ensure that you're only enabling the triggers that are relevant to you, and adding any necessary customizations required by your business logic here to avoid overwriting on updates.
5. **Finalize:**
   * Click the **Unpack** button.
   * Once done, you can test the Crate by completing a related task and watching for the Crate's success.

Remember, unpacking essentially prepares the Crate for your organization. After unpacking, always check its performance to ensure it's functioning as expected.

## Example Crate configuration

You can see which integrations that are required for each Crate, and choose to enable for this organization or all managed organizations.

If you enable a workflow but the client doesn't have the required integration, you'll receive a warning and a link to set that up as required.
