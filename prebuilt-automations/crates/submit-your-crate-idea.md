# Submit your Crate idea

### Submit your idea

Crates are crucially important to Rewst, and allow us to put some awesome workflows in the hands of all of our clients without any additional configuration needed. The aim is to have our ROC team continually add to the Crate marketplace, with new Crates for you explore on a regular basis.

We aim to give our clients what they want. If you have any cool workflow ideas, submit your Crate ideas by going to the [Crate Roadmap in Canny](https://rewst.canny.io/crates) and create a post.
