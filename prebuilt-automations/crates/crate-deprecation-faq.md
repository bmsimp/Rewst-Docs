<summary>Why is a Crate deprecated?</summary>

Crates are deprecated when they've been replaced by newer versions offering improved functionality, ease of use, better resilience, and ongoing support.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will deprecated Crates still be supported?</summary>

Rewst support will continue to provide best effort support to help resolve issues with deprecated Crates. However, if a fault is identified within a deprecated Crate, we'll suggest you migrate to the new Crates for the best long-term solution.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will my deprecated Crates stop working after their deprecation date?</summary>

Your existing workflows using deprecated Crates will continue functioning normally. Deprecation means these Crates won't receive future updates or enhancements.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long do I have to migrate to the new Crates?</summary>

While there's no hard deadline for migration, we recommend migrating soon to ensure you benefit from the latest features, updates, and ongoing support.

<details>

<summary>What happens if I've built a wrapper around current workflows?</summary>

Your custom wrappers will continue to function normally. However, we recommend reviewing them against the new Crates to leverage enhanced capabilities.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I've unsynced and modified my workflows?</summary>

Your modified workflows will keep working, but you should consider migrating your customizations into the new Crate structure to maintain access to future enhancements and support.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I built my own forms pointing to old workflows?</summary>

Your custom forms will remain operational, but we recommend updating your forms to integrate with the new Crates to ensure compatibility and support.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are existing forms supported by the new workflows?</summary>

Generally, yesâ€”but we advise verifying compatibility and functionality after migration. Reach out to support for assistance if you encounter any issues.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What will be the impact on my customers?</summary>

End customers will experience no immediate impact. However, migrating to the newer Crates ensures ongoing reliability, support, and enhancements for their onboarding and offboarding processes.
