<summary>Avoiding wet documentation</summary>

* **Excessive notes add visual clutter** – Too many notes make workflows harder to read.
* **Overuse of comments** – Documenting every action can make it difficult to identify key information.
* **Inefficient documentation takes time** – When documentation requires extra effort to parse, it defeats its purpose.

<details>

<summary>Applying dry documentation principles</summary>

* **Use clear, descriptive names** – Well-named actions and variables reduce the need for extra notes.
* **Document only where necessary** – Focus on clarifying key outcomes rather than restating what is already clear.
* **Leverage AI tools** – Features like RoboRusty generate documentation automatically, reducing manual effort.
