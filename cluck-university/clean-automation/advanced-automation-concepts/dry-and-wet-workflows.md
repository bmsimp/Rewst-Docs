# DRY and WET workflows

## Module overview

In this module, we explore how to build efficient, error-resistant workflows by embracing clean automation principles. You'll discover the benefits of reducing redundancy with DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and the pitfalls of the WET (Write Everything Twice) approach.

<details>

<summary>Why it matters</summary>

* Clean automation principles maximize value and minimize tech debt.
* Reducing redundancy boosts efficiency and prevents errors

</details>

<details>

<summary>The DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)</summary>

* Avoid unnecessary repetition in workflows.
* Repeating actions increases complexity and maintenance effort.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The opposite: WET (Write Everything Twice)</summary>

* Using the same action multiple times creates inefficiency.
* Updates become error-prone when changes must be made in multiple places.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Applying DRY in workflows</summary>

* **Consolidate repeated actions** to simplify automation.
* **Structure workflows efficiently** to retrieve and use data effectively.
* **Plan automation design carefully** to prevent unnecessary duplication.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The impact</summary>

* Fewer errors, easier updates, and clearer workflow logic.
* More scalable, efficient, and maintainable automations.

</details>

By following the DRY principle, your workflows will remain streamlined, effective, and easier to manage.
