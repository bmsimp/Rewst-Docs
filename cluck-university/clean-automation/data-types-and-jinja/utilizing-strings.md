<summary>Why it matters</summary>

* Strings are a fundamental data type in automation and programming.
* Understanding how to modify, combine, and extract information from strings is key to effective data processing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Basic string operations</summary>

* **Creating strings** – Define text values using double or single quotes.
* **Concatenation** – Join multiple strings together using the `~` (tilde) symbol.
* **Filters for modification** – Use filters like `lower`, `upper`, and `capitalize` to adjust string formatting.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Handling missing or inconsistent values</summary>

* **Lowercasing for consistency** – Convert strings to lowercase to avoid case-sensitivity issues.
* **Using the `default` filter** – Provide a fallback value for empty or missing strings to prevent errors.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Advanced string manipulation</summary>

* **String slicing** – Extract specific portions of a string using index ranges.
* **String splitting** – Break a long string into a list of segments based on a defined separator.
* **String joining** – Combine list items into a single string with a specified separator.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Typecasting strings</summary>

Converting data types – Change numbers or other data types into strings for easier manipulation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The impact</summary>

* Enhances data consistency and reliability in your workflows.
* Reduces errors related to case sensitivity and missing values.
* Improves automation efficiency by enabling flexible text processing.
