# Understanding data types

## Module overview

In this module, you'll learn how data is structured and used in automation. The video provides an in-depth look at both basic and complex data types, from characters and strings to integers, floats, lists, and dictionaries. By understanding these building blocks and their syntax, you'll be equipped to handle information effectively in Jinja and build more organized, error-resistant workflows.

<summary>Why it matters</summary>

* Knowing data types is essential for managing information effectively in Jinja and automation.
* Different data types dictate how data is processed, stored, and manipulated.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Basic data types</summary>

* **Characters** – A single letter, number, or symbol (e.g., @, #, &).
* **Strings** – Sequences of characters, including letters, numbers, and spaces, enclosed in quotes.
* **Integers** – Whole numbers, both positive and negative, without decimals.
* **Floats** – Numbers with decimals, also known as floating-point numbers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Complex data types</summary>

* **Lists** – Ordered collections of items enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. Items can include strings, numbers, or even other lists.
* **Dictionaries** – Collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{ }`, used to represent structured objects like tickets, users, or devices.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Identifying data types by syntax</summary>

* **Lists use square brackets `[ ]`** – Indicate an ordered collection of values.
* **Dictionaries use curly braces `{ }`** – Contain key-value pairs to define structured objects.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The impact</summary>

* Understanding these data types ensures accurate and effective data handling in Jinja.
* Organizes automation workflows logically, reducing errors by matching the right type to each scenario.
* Empowers you to create automation that is both efficient and scalable.

Mastering these data types sets the stage for building automation workflows that are not only precise and reliable but also primed for future enhancements.
