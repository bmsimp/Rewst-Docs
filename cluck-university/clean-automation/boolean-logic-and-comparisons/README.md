## What to expect

**Boolean logic and comparisons** is a foundational course that explores how true/false values and logical operators control workflow logic in automation. This course covers essential Boolean operations, truthy and falsy values, and optimization techniques to simplify decision-making processes in Jinja. By applying these principles, learners will improve workflow efficiency, reduce errors, and create more maintainable automation.
