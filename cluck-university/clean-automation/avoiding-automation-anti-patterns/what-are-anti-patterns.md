# What are anti-patterns?

## Module overview

In this module, you'll learn what anti-patterns are and how they can hinder your automation efforts. The video outlines common pitfalls—like cargo cult programming, the golden hammer, and god workflows—that lead to inefficient, hard-to-maintain processes. By understanding these anti-patterns, you can avoid technical debt and design scalable, effective automations.

<summary>Why this matters</summary>

* Anti-patterns create inefficient, hard-to-maintain workflows.
* They lead to technical debt and slow down automation improvements.
* Recognizing these pitfalls is key to building scalable, effective automation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are anti-patterns? </summary>

* They are common but harmful practices that increase complexity and maintenance challenges.
* Unlike design patterns, which offer best-practice solutions, anti-patterns often make your code less clear and more error-prone.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Common anti-patterns</summary>

* **Cargo cult programming**
  * _What it is:_ Copying solutions without understanding them.
  * _Why it’s a problem:_ It introduces unnecessary complexity and unclear logic.
  * _How to avoid it:_ Always question why a solution works before adopting it.
* **Golden hammer**
  * _What it is:_ Relying on one tool or method for every problem.
  * _Why it’s a problem:_ It reduces flexibility and leads to inefficiencies.
  * _How to avoid it:_ Evaluate each problem individually and choose the best approach.
* **God workflow**
  * _What it is:_ Overloading a workflow with too many responsibilities.
  * _Why it’s a problem:_ It becomes difficult to maintain, debug, and scale.
  * _How to avoid it:_ Break workflows into modular sub-workflows with clear responsibilities.

<summary>How to apply this in automation</summary>

* **Think before copying:** Understand workflows thoroughly before reusing them.
* **Use the right tool for the job:** Avoid forcing a single solution onto every problem.
* **Keep workflows simple:** Modular designs are easier to maintain and scale.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The impact</summary>

* **Efficient workflows:** Avoiding anti-patterns leads to cleaner, more manageable automation.
* **Scalability:** Modular, well-designed workflows adapt more easily to change.
* **Reduced technical debt:** Clear, concise automation minimizes long-term maintenance issues.

</details>

By understanding and avoiding these anti-patterns, you can build automation that is not only efficient and scalable but also easier to maintain and improve over time.
