## What to expect

Modular abstraction through automation explores how breaking down workflows into reusable, self-contained components improves scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. By applying abstraction techniques, learners will reduce redundancy, simplify workflow logic, and create adaptable automation solutions.

When you've completed this training, [don't forget to get credit!](https://app.rewst.io/form/01914838-dbdb-7d72-ba21-1070334b2811)
