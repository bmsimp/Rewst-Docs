<summary>Why it matters</summary>

* Prevents scope creep and unnecessary complexity.
* Keeps workflows easy to maintain and scale.
* Reduces debugging time and prevents cascading failures.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Monolithic design: Fast but risky</summary>

* **Built as one big unit:** Everything is tightly coupled.
* **Quick to create:** Ideal for simple workflows with just a few steps.
* **Hard to modify and scale:** One small change can break the entire system.
* **Analogy:** Like shaping clay—easy at first, but once hardened, difficult to adjust.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Modular design: Scalable and flexible</summary>

* **Breaks workflows into independent parts:** Components work like Lego pieces.
* **Takes more time upfront:** But simplifies maintenance in the long run.
* **Easier to modify and scale:** Changes to a module apply wherever it’s used.
* **Analogy:** Like building with Lego pieces—designed for reuse and flexibility.

<summary>The trade-off</summary>

| **Monolithic**               | **Modular**                   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Fast to build                | Slower upfront but scalable   |
| Hard to modify               | Easy to update                |
| Changes can break everything | Changes are isolated          |
| Good for small tasks         | Best for long-term automation |

<summary>Best practices</summary>

* **Follow the KISS principle:** Keep it simple.
* **Break workflows into reusable sub-workflows:** Reduce overall complexity.
* **Limit dependencies:** Avoid tightly coupled designs.
* **Optimize conditions and logic:** Prevent unnecessary processing.

By designing workflows that are "stupidly simple," you ensure your automation remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to troubleshoot, saving time and reducing complexity in the long run.
