# Thinking like a developer

## Module overview

In this module, you'll learn how to think like a developer by leveraging abstraction to hide complexity and focus on essential components. The video explores how abstraction simplifies workflows, enhances reusability, and improves maintainability by exposing only what’s necessary. You'll see real-world analogies and practical examples in Jinja, empowering you to design automation that is both efficient and easy to manage.

<summary>Why it matters</summary>

* **Simplifies workflows:** Focus on necessary details while ignoring non-essential complexity.
* **Enhances reusability:** Modular components can be reused across different workflows.
* **Improves maintainability:** Reduces clutter and potential errors in automation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is abstraction? </summary>

* Abstraction means focusing on high-level details while hiding unnecessary complexity.
* In automation, it allows you to design workflows efficiently without exposing every underlying step.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Real-world example: Making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich</summary>

* When you say "make a sandwich," you abstract away details like the type of bread or how to spread the peanut butter.
* Similarly, in programming, abstraction simplifies workflow design by hiding intricate details.

<details>

<summary>Applying abstraction in automation </summary>

* **Inputs and parameters:** Expose only essential variables while managing complexity internally.
* **Modular workflows:** Break down processes into smaller, reusable components.
* **Layering complexity:** Structure processes into manageable pieces that build on each other.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The impact</summary>

* **Cleaner automation:** Reveals only what’s necessary, reducing visual clutter.
* **Greater flexibility:** Modular design adapts to various use cases with ease.
* **Scalability:** Simplified processes are easier to extend and maintain over time.

</details>

By embracing abstraction, you'll create automation workflows that are not only more efficient and reusable but also easier to understand and scale as your needs evolve.
