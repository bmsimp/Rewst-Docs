# What is pseudocode?

## Module overview

In this module, you'll learn how to use pseudocode to structure and refine workflows before implementation. The video demonstrates how planning with pseudocode streamlines development, reduces errors, and highlights reusable components, ultimately leading to more efficient and scalable automation in Rewst.

<summary>Why pseudocode matters</summary>

* Provides a structured way to plan workflows without worrying about syntax.
* Reduces inefficiencies that come from directly translating human thought into code.
* Helps identify reusable components, improving overall maintainability.

<summary>Steps to build effective workflows</summary>

1. **Define the goal** – Clearly state what process you're automating and the expected outcome.
2. **Break it into steps** – Identify key actions and dependencies.
3. **Consider reusability** – Determine if any steps can be turned into a sub-workflow.
4. **Write pseudocode** – Organize the logic in a clear, readable format.
5. **Review and optimize** – Walk through the logic to ensure clarity and efficiency.
6. **Implement in Rewst** – Convert your refined pseudocode into an actual workflow.

<summary>Best practices for structuring workflows</summary>

* **Start small:** Test automation on a limited scale before full deployment.
* **Keep it modular:** Use sub-workflows to enhance flexibility and maintainability.
* **Name things clearly:** Use descriptive names for variables and workflows to boost readability.

<details>

<summary>Testing and refinement</summary>

* Manually verify each step before scaling up.
* Use Jinja for preliminary testing of logic and formatting.
* Continuously refine workflows to optimize performance.

By using pseudocode as your blueprint, you'll streamline development, reduce errors, and build automation workflows that are both efficient and scalable.
