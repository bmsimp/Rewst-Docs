# God functions and workflows

## Module overview

In this module, you'll learn how to improve workflow clarity and maintainability by embracing modular design instead of overloaded, monolithic structures. The video explores the pitfalls of god workflows, highlights the benefits of isolating functionality into smaller sub-workflows, and offers practical guidance for building scalable, maintainable automation in Rewst.

<details>

<summary>Why it matters</summary>

* **Easier maintenance:** Isolated components simplify debugging.
* **Scalability:** Modular workflows adapt to change without breaking.
* **Better performance:** Reduces unnecessary logic and dependencies.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The problem with god workflows</summary>

* A god workflow (or god function) attempts to handle everything in one massive automation.
* Results in overcomplicated logic that’s hard to modify.
* Introduces a high risk of errors with any change.
* Leads to slow troubleshooting due to tight dependencies.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Signs of a god workflow</summary>

* Large conditional blocks with many transitions.
* No clear separation of responsibilities.
* Hard to describe in a single sentence.

<summary>Monolithic vs. modular workflows</summary>

| Feature         | God workflow (monolithic)                    | Modular workflow                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Complexity**  | High – too many responsibilities             | Low – focused sub-workflows           |
| **Scalability** | Difficult – changes risk breaking everything | Easy – reusable components            |
| **Debugging**   | Hard – must test the whole workflow          | Simple – test parts independently     |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid – everything is interconnected         | Adaptable – components can be swapped |

</details>

<details>

<summary>Building modular workflows</summary>

* **Use sub-workflows:** Each should handle one specific task.
* **Name clearly:** Use descriptive, action-based names (e.g., `create_ticket`).
* **Limit inputs:** Only pass necessary data.
* **Reuse components:** Avoid duplicating logic.
* **Test often:** Validate sub-workflows before integrating them into larger processes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The impact</summary>

* **Cleaner workflows:** Avoids excessive complexity.
* **Better collaboration:** Makes it easier for teams to understand and update processes.
* **Future-proof automation:** Modular design ensures long-term efficiency.

By avoiding god workflows and using modular design, your automation will remain scalable, maintainable, and easy to troubleshoot.
