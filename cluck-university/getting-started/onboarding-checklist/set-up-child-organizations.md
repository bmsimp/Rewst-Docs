# Set up child organizations

## Four ways to set up child organizations

To make automations work for your managed clients/customers, set them up as _child_ organizations.&#x20;

We recommend using the Bulk Create Client from PSA crate to add the majority of your customers quickly, and using the Add Client to Rewst crate for each new client you add in the future. You can also add organizations manually or through the Microsoft CSP integration.

## Configure child organization variables

Set child organization variables in Rewst to customize automation settings for your customers and to override the global defaults from your MSP organization variables as needed. We recommend using the **Configure Organizational Variables** crate to do this. You can also make updates manually via **Configuration > Organization Variables** in the Rewst left-side navigation menu.

Each new customer must be mapped to integrations. Using the Add Client to Rewst crate can streamline this process.
