# Onboarding Checklist

## Getting started with Rewst

Follow this checklist to set up your Rewst environment and get value from the platform immediately with popular **crates** — prebuilt automations for common MSP processes.

### Take a Rewst platform tour and add users

Learn about the main areas you'll be working in as you set things up.

Need to add someone at your organization to Rewst? Invite them as an Admin or Member: [Add a user to a parent organization](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/user-management/how-to-add-and-remove-users#add-a-user-to-a-parent-organization).
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set up 5 key integrations for your MSP

{% hint style="success" %}
Begin by integrating each tool for your MSP. Later, you'll come back to finish the **organization mapping** process for your customers.

* [PSA overview](integrate-your-psa.md)
* [RMM overview](integrate-your-rmm.md)
* [Microsoft Cloud bundle overview](integrate-the-microsoft-cloud-bundle.md)
* [Documentation overview](integrate-your-documentation-tool.md)
* [Licensing overview](integrate-your-licensing-tool.md)
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set organization variables for your MSP

Understanding Rewst **organizations** and **organization variables** is essential to setting up the platform. The [intro-to-organizations-and-organization-variables.md](intro-to-organizations-and-organization-variables.md "mention") page guides you through:

* Visualizing the "parent > child" organization hierarchy
* Using the "Configure Organizational Variables" crate to get started with org variables
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Configure Rewst for your customers

You don't want to limit automations to _just_ work for your MSP organization, right? Let's make sure you add your customers. The [set-up-child-organizations.md](set-up-child-organizations.md "mention") page guides you through:

* Four ways to set up child organizations
* How to override default org variables and create unique org variables if needed
* How to complete the **organization mapping** process for your integrations
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Start automating common MSP processes with crates

What's in a crate? Watch this video to dive into crate components and how they work.

{% hint style="success" %}
You've already used a few crates — e.g., Configure Organizational Variables — to set up your environment. Now, unpack crates that leverage your new integrations! Check out [Stewart's favorite crates](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/crates/stewarts-30-favorite-crates).
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Wrap up your onboarding

Navigate through your Rewst environment to check that everything is set up correctly.

1. In **Settings > Users**, check that you've invited other users for your organization.
2. In **Settings > Organizations**, check that all managed customer accounts are set up.&#x20;
3. In **Configuration > Integrations**, check that you've successfully integrated and authorized each tool for your MSP _and_ that you've completed the **organization mapping** process.
   * PSA
   * RMM
   * Cloud tool(s)
   * Documentation tool
   * Licensing tool
4. In **Configuration > Organization Variables**, check that you've set up org variables for your MSP that are configured as the "defaults" for child organizations as needed.
5. In **Configuration > Organization Variables**, filter each child organization to check that org variables are set up (e.g. to override the defaults where needed).
6. In **Automations**, check **Workflows** and **Forms** for unpacked crate components. For a simple way to find a crate’s starting point, go to **Crates > Crate Marketplace**, select the crate, and select "View Workflow."
