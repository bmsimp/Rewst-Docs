## Lesson summary

<details>

<summary>What is automation?</summary>

Automation uses technology to handle repetitive tasks, making processes faster, more consistent, and less prone to errors.

<details>

<summary>Task-based vs. process-based automation</summary>

* **Task-based**: Automates a single action (e.g., sending an email).
* **Process-based**: Automates a full workflow across systems (e.g., onboarding a new hire). **Rewst focuses on process-based automation** to handle complex sequences from start to finish.

<summary>What makes automation successful?</summary>

Automation works best for **repetitive, stable tasks** with **accessible data**.

Start with simple processes and **stay goal-focused** to get the most value from your automations. For example, automating user account creation works well because it’s a frequent task with standard steps and required information readily available.

Tasks that require constant human judgment or have unpredictable steps are not good for automation. For example, troubleshooting complex technical issues often requires nuanced decisions that automation can't handle effectively.
