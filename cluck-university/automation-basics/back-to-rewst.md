## Lesson summary

<details>

<summary>Revisiting the Rewst platform</summary>

Rewst’s **Automations Tab** is where you create and manage workflows that automate tasks and processes:

* **Workflows**: Step-by-step instructions that run automations.
* **Forms**: Collect data and trigger workflows.
* **Crates**: Pre-built workflows to get started quickly and boost ROI.

The **Tools Tab** includes the **Jinja Live Editor**, where you can practice working with JSON data and test expressions before using them in workflows.

<summary>How core concepts fit into workflows</summary>

The technical concepts you’ve learned—like APIs, JSON, variables, and webhooks—power Rewst workflows.

Example: In a new hire onboarding workflow:

* A form triggers the workflow.
* An API call creates the new hire’s account.
* Data is stored in **context variables** for later use.
* A **subworkflow** assigns permissions based on the employee’s role.

<summary>Why it matters</summary>

Understanding how these concepts connect makes Rewst more approachable and helps you build scalable, adaptable automations. These tools let you streamline complex processes while keeping workflows dynamic and reusable.
