## Module summary

<details>

<summary>What are webhooks?</summary>

A **webhook** is like a notification that triggers a workflow as soon as an event happens—no need to constantly check for updates.

Example: When a customer submits a support ticket, a webhook instantly sends that information to Rewst, starting the workflow right away.

<summary>How do webhooks work?</summary>

Webhooks follow a simple process:

1. **An event happens** (e.g., a new ticket is submitted).
2. **The webhook sends a message** (called a payload) to a URL.
3. **A workflow is triggered** based on that message.

This real-time process keeps workflows efficient and responsive.

<details>

<summary>What are parameters?</summary>

**Parameters** are like fill-in-the-blank options that make workflows adaptable.

Example: Instead of hardcoding a date, you can use a parameter like _ReminderDate_ to customize it each time the workflow runs.

<summary>Why they work together</summary>

Webhooks deliver data to workflows, and parameters use that data to customize actions. Together, they make workflows more flexible, reusable, and real-time—keeping your automations efficient and dynamic.
