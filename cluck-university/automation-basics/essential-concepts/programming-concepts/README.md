# Basic programming concepts

## Module overview

:egg: In Rewst, workflows need to "think" and adapt to different scenarios, and that's where programming concepts like if statements and for loops come in. In this module, you’ll explore how workflows can make decisions and process lists of data—laying the groundwork for building more dynamic, flexible automations.

## Module summary

<details>

<summary>If statements – making decisions</summary>

An **if statement** allows a workflow to make decisions based on conditions.

Example:

* **If** a support ticket is marked "urgent," then send a priority notification.This helps workflows adapt to different situations, taking specific actions when certain conditions are met.

</details>

<details>

<summary>For loops – processing lists</summary>

A **for loop** goes through a list, one item at a time.

Example:

* **For each ticket in a list**, check its status.

For loops let workflows handle multiple items efficiently without needing to manually check each one.

<summary>Putting it together – smart workflows</summary>

If statements and for loops often work together to create dynamic workflows.

Example:

* **For each customer in a list**, check if they have an overdue balance.
* **If** their balance is overdue, follow up.

This combination makes workflows more adaptable, efficient, and capable of handling real-world scenarios automatically.
