## Quick brainstorm

Think of a process you handle repeatedly, like reviewing support tickets or following up on overdue payments. Write down a condition you would check (e.g., "Is the ticket marked urgent?") and a list you might go through (e.g., "List of open tickets"). This will help you see where **if statements** and **for loops** could simplify your work through automation.

## If statements and for loops activity&#x20;

#### Real-life scenarios: If statement or for loop?&#x20;

Consider the following scenarios and determine if each would require “if statement” or “for loop” logic.

#### MSP & IT automation scenarios: If statement or for loop? &#x20;

Now let’s try real tech and automation examples that a you might encounter.

If statement

</details>

<details>

<summary>A script applies a software patch to every workstation in a company</summary>

For loop

</details>

<details>

<summary>A system scans each open to ticket to see if it's marked "urgent" </summary>

If statement

</details>

<details>

<summary>A workflow sends an alert only when a backup fails</summary>

If statement

## Rewrite a workflow in if and for terms

Take a real-world IT process and break it into "if" statements and "for" loops. Here’s an example:

#### Scenario: Password expiration checks

A company requires all employees to update their passwords every 90 days.

Logic as an automation rule:

* For each employee in the company:
  * If their password is older than 90 days, send a reminder email.

#### Your turn

Think of a simple MSP-related automation you’ve seen or heard of.

* How would you describe it using IF statements and FOR loops?

#### Recap: What did we learn?

* IF statements check conditions and make decisions.
* FOR loops repeat tasks across multiple items.
* Both are crucial for IT automation, especially in MSP workflows.
