## Module summary

<details>

<summary>What are forms?</summary>

Forms collect the information your workflows need to start. Instead of gathering details manually, forms streamline data collection, like capturing a new employee’s name, department, and start date in one step.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Key fields in forms</summary>

Forms use different types of **fields** to collect data:

* **Text fields** for names or notes.
* **Date fields** for deadlines.
* **Dropdowns** for set options.

Using the right fields ensures your workflows receive clean, organized data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How forms and parameters work together</summary>

Forms collect core information, while parameters customize workflows based on that data. For example, a form might gather a customer’s details, and a parameter like ReminderDate allows you to set a specific follow-up date on the fly.

<summary>Why forms matter</summary>

Forms kick off workflows with the right data, reducing delays and back-and-forth. Paired with parameters, they make workflows adaptable and reusable across different scenarios.

## Practice activities

* Think of a process you frequently handle that requires gathering information—like onboarding a new client or requesting approval for a task. Write down the **key details** you’d need to collect and consider which **fields** (text, date, dropdown) would best capture that data. This will help you start thinking about how forms can simplify data collection in your workflows.
