<summary>What are data types?</summary>

Data types are labels that tell computers what kind of information they’re working with. Just like you organize items in your home by category—books, clothes, groceries—computers organize data by type to know how to process it.

<summary>Common data types you’ll use in Rewst</summary>

Here are the main data types to know:

* **Strings**: Text, like names, messages, or IDs (e.g., _"Hello, world!"_ or _"12345ABC"_).
* **Numbers**: Can be whole numbers (**integers**) or decimals (**floats**).
* **Booleans**: Simple yes/no values (e.g., _true/false_ or _on/off_).
* **Lists**: Collections of related items (e.g., _\["apples", "oranges", "bananas"]_).
* **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs that organize related information (e.g., _"Name": "John Doe"_, _"Age": 30_)
