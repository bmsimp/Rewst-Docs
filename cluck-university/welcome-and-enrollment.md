# Welcome and enrollment

## Getting started

To kick off your automation journey, we have an entire [getting-started](getting-started/ "mention") section dedicated to introducing you to both automation practices as well as the Rewst Platform itself. Dive in and get your talons wet with the basics, including some exercises!

## On-demand training

We offer courses sequentially, and you can use the self-serve resources. Use the hyperlinks below to get started. Let us know if you hit a roadblock or have questions in our [Cluck University Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/WKwsZngc). If you stick to it, you’ll have your [certification](rewst-foundations/foundations-certification.md) in no time!&#x20;

To maximize your learning experience, it's recommended to complete the sessions in order. On-demand recordings are available for our global audience, or for rewatching at your own pace.
