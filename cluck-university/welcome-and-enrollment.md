# Welcome and enrollment

## Getting Started

To kick off your automation journey, we have an entire [getting-started](getting-started/ "mention") section dedicated to introducing you to both automation practices as well as the Rewst Platform itself. Dive in and get your talons wet with the basics, including some exercises!

## On-Demand Training

We offer sessions sequentially, and you can use the self-serve resources. Use the hyperlinks below to get started, and let us know if you hit a roadblock along the way, or have questions in our [Cluck University Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/WKwsZngc). If you stick to it, you’ll have your [certification](rewst-foundations/foundations-certification.md) in no time!&#x20;

## Live Training Enrollment

If you're interested in taking the Clean Automation series live, [you can sign up](https://calendly.com/cluck-u) and join the legendary Eddie Chow for 5 sessions that will be delivered over 2 weeks.&#x20;

To maximize your learning experience, it's recommended to complete the sessions in order. On-demand recordings are available for our global audience, or for rewatching at your own pace.
