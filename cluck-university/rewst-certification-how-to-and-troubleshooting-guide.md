# Rewst certification how-to and troubleshooting guide

{% hint style="warning" %}
We highly recommend that all Rewst users be certified before attempting to build workflows or customize Crates. Completing proper training sets you up to succeed with Rewst, and helps prevent poorly executed workflow design. As of late 2024, some geographic locations are not yet able to participate in Rewst’s asynchronous certification process. We’re working to fix this as soon as possible.&#x20;

## Rewst certification overview

Get your Rewst Certifications! They’re badges of honor that you can wear with pride. Once you’ve completed your coursework in Cluck University, you’re eligible to take the certification exams related to each series.

Rewst offers a different certification exam for each of our two Cluck University series:

1. The Rewst Foundations Certification is an essential step in validating your skills in automating workflow processes, encompassing the knowledge from our Rewst Foundations training in Cluck University. Topics for questions include workflow mechanics, Jinja templating, API integration, task transitions, and workflow design. This certification is also what earns you your Discord badge as a Certified Rewster. More on how to take the Rewst Foundations Certification can be found in our [foundations-certification.md](rewst-foundations/foundations-certification.md "mention") help document.\

2. The Rewst Clean Automation Certification requires knowledge and skills in applying best practice principles and avoiding anti-patterns from the courses, learned in our Clean Automation training in Cluck University. This certification aims to test you on the necessary skills and best practices for building robust, scalable, and maintainable automation workflows. More on how to take the Rewst Clean Automation Certification can be found in our [clean-automation-certification.md](clean-automation/clean-automation-certification.md "mention") help document.

## Fix a missing badge or channel access in Discord

Your first step when troubleshooting your access to Rewst’s Discord server should always be to make sure that you’ve [completed our verification procedures](https://docs.rewst.help/support/roc-support/discord-join-and-verification).

If you’ve verified yourself in your server and are still missing a badge or access to a relevant channel, reach out to your CSM. They’ll work with Rewst staff to get your access squared away.
