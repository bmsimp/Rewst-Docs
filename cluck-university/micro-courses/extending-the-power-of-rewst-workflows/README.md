***

[part-1-introduction-to-completion-handlers.md](part-1-introduction-to-completion-handlers.md "mention")

***

**Objective:** This section introduces the concept of completion handlers in Rewst. It explains how these handlers can extend or modify existing workflows, particularly useful for pre-built automations or [Crates](../../../prebuilt-automations/crates/)​​.&#x20;

**Key Concepts:**

* Understanding the role and function of completion handlers and workflow listeners​​.
* Steps to configure a completion handler, including defining trigger conditions and saving settings​​.&#x20;

**Practical Application:** It includes a hands-on section for creating a new workflow as a handler, demonstrating the practical implementation of completion handlers in Rewst​​.&#x20;

**Outcome:** Gain proficiency in enhancing workflows using completion handlers, enabling layered automation without altering original workflows​​.

**Objective:** This part delves into applying completion handlers to enhance specific workflows like the new employee onboarding process. The focus is on creating an email template connected to the onboarding workflow using completion handlers​​.&#x20;

**Key Concepts:**

* The importance of keeping workflows synced for updates and optimizations, and how completion handlers provide flexibility without unsyncing workflows​​.
* Understanding the data from employee onboarding workflows using tools like the Jinja Live Editor​​.
* Building an email template with relevant user information using Jinja syntax​​.&#x20;

**Practical Application:** Steps to create a simple completion handler workflow, including organization validation and sending emails using the created template​​. Demonstrates how to configure this workflow as a completion handler​​.&#x20;

**Outcome:** Learn to simplify complex processes and apply these techniques to other Rewst crates for enhanced workflow customization​​.
