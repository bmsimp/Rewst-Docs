# Lesson 6: Implementing error handling in Rewst workflows

## Whatt to Eggs-pect

After completing this lesson, participants will be able to:

1. Build in "error handling" for a workflow by adding "on failure" transitions to actions
2. Implement feedback messages by using data aliases
3. Identify use cases for "Task Transition Criteria Sensitivity" on actions

### **Prerequisite(s)**

In this lesson, we finish the "Add or Remove User - Microsoft Group" workflow. Make sure you've completed [managing-workflow-paths](../managing-workflow-paths/ "mention") before starting this lesson to ensure you're prepared for the next steps in the process.

## Lesson Modules

To get started, select the first module. Each module includes a video and written guidance with resources, followed by navigation to go back/forward. To wrap up the lesson, visit [#next-steps](./#next-steps "mention")

### Keep On Cluckin'

We implemented error handling by adding feedback messages to notify us of the success or failure of our Graph and Exchange Online actions. We also briefly touched on the Task Transition Criteria Sensitivity setting, which will be covered in more detail in \[lesson here].

In the next lesson, we'll wrap up by optimizing the workflow, streamlining the feedback messages to be sent directly to the person who filled out the form, and enhancing both the workflow's functionality and design.
