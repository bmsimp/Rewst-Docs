# Building the "Add or Remove User - Microsoft Group" form

## Module Overview

:bulb: Every Rewst workflow begins with a "trigger." Here, our trigger will be a Rewst form. The form will include fields for selecting a user, a group, and an action (add or remove).

<summary>Step 2: Create the User Selection Field</summary>

3. **Label** the field "User" and provide a clear description like "Select a user."
4. **Make** the field required and enable _Dynamic Options_ to pull data from Microsoft Graph, selecting _Microsoft Graph_ as the integration and _Users_ as the Resource.

:star: Title case matters! Ensure the **Field Name** is lowercase, one word (or if using multiple words, joined with an underscore as per this example).

3. **Define** the options: "Add to Group" with a value of "add" and "Remove from Group" with a value of "remove." Title case is important! Ensure all "values" are lowercase, one word.
4. **Ensure** the field is required and save your work.

</details>

<summary>Step 5: Save and Preview</summary>

1. **Save** your form by clicking the _disk icon_ and selecting "submit."

:star: Remember: Making mistakes is part of the learning process! If you make an error while building your form, you can always go back and edit or delete fields.

### Action Items

* Create your form in Rewst following the steps outlined above, ensuring you include fields for user selection, group selection, and action selection.
* Make sure to set up your Microsoft Graph integration if you havenâ€™t already, as it's required for the dynamic options in the form fields (and you'll see those after creating the workflow).
