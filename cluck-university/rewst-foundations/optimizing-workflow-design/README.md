# Lesson 7: Optimizing workflow design

## **What to Eggs-pect**

After completing this lesson, participants will be able to:

1. Configure workflow output to store feedback messages that will be retrieved in a "parent" workflow
2. Update a form to handle multiple items at once for efficiency
3. Use 'With Items' to loop through a list of items on a workflow action
4. Create an email action that shares relevant, customized feedback for each workflow execution

### **Prerequisite(s)**

In this lesson, we create a parent workflow that will contain the workflow that you finished creating in "Implementing Error-Handling in Rewst Workflows"
