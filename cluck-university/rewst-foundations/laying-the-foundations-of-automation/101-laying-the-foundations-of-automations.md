This will be a step-by-step journey, starting simple and iterating on the process over time -- from an MVP of a workflow (with just 3 steps) to using a sub-workflow in a parent workflow for ultimate automation efficiency. Here's a snapshot of what you'll do in upcoming lessons:

#### Building a Basic Form and Workflow

**Main Objective:** Create a basic automation with three steps: adding or removing a user from a group using the Microsoft Graph integration.

<details>

<summary>Steps:</summary>

1. **Build** a request form that triggers the automation.
2. **Connect** the form to a workflow where the automation takes place.
3. **Test** the workflow to ensure it works correctly.

</details>

#### Jinja Essentials for Workflow Automation

**Main Objective:** Learn how to use Jinja, the templating engine in Rewst, to pass data through your workflows for specific results.

<details>

<summary>Steps:</summary>

1. **Review** the basics of Jinja syntax.
2. **Apply** Jinja in the _Live Editor_ to manipulate data (and test your code).

</details>

#### Creating an Option Generator Workflow

**Main Objective:** Enhance your request form by creating a workflow that generates relevant options based on the user and action selected.

**Bonus:** In one of the modules for this lesson, you'll learn how to customize your own action (if a "pre-built" action in Rewst doesn't yet exist) by using API documentation.

<details>

<summary>Steps:</summary>

1. **Build** an option generator workflow.
2. **Update** the request form to connect to this workflow.
3. **Test** the updated form to ensure it displays the correct groups.

</details>

#### Managing Workflow Paths

**Main Objective:** Handle group updates that require Microsoft Exchange Online using Powershell commands.

<details>

<summary>Steps:</summary>

1. **Identify** which groups need to be updated through _Exchange Online_.
2. **Integrate** _Powershell_ commands into your workflow.

</details>

#### Implementing Error-Handling in Rewst Workflows

**Main Objective:** Add techniques for error-handling to a workflow.

<details>

<summary>Steps:</summary>

1. **Add** "on failure" transitions to certain actions
2. **Create** data aliases to store feedback messages for the results of certain actions
3. **Learn** why/when to update "task transition criteria sensitivity" on an action

</details>

#### Optimizing Workflow Design

**Main Objective:** Combine everything you've learned to create an efficient automation that updates multiple groups and provides feedback.

<details>

<summary>Steps:</summary>

1. **Update** your request form to handle multiple groups.
2. **Use** a sub-workflow and "with items" to process each group for the user and action.
3. **Set up** an email notification to inform the requester of the automation results.
