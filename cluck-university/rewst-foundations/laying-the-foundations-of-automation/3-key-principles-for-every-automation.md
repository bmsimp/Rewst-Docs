<summary>3 Key Principles to Automation</summary>

**1. Aharon's Law: You can't document a process that doesn't exist.**&#x20;

Start with documenting the process and make sure you involve colleagues to gather key information about the process, identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and ensure alignment on the goals/objectives.

**2. The best automations are forgettable...so figure out how you'll measure the value of an automation from the start!**&#x20;

This may be time saved or a different metric (or set of metrics), and goes back to the benefits of automation.

**3. Start with small, simple, frequent tasks.**

...or, start with just a few steps. Test, refine, and build from there.

Keep it simple -- selecting a well-defined, automatable task that's part of a larger process is a great starting point.&#x20;
* Make sure to collaborate with stakeholders to ensure your task/process is well-documented, and consider creating a diagram/flowchart to help you translate these starting points into the visual interface of a Rewst workflow.
