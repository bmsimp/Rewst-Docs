<summary>4. Scoping your automation</summary>

Once you’ve decided that automation is the way forward, the next step is to scope your automation projects effectively. Automation can generally be divided into **tasks** and **processes**.

**Tasks:**

* Typically involve simple, repetitive actions that can be handled by one or two tools with a few steps.
* Examples include funneling tickets into specific queues or updating multiple fields across tickets.

**Processes:**

* These are more complex and involve automating a series of related tasks, often across multiple tools.
* An example might be automating customer onboarding or offboarding, which involves several steps and interactions across different platforms.

<summary>5. Getting started</summary>

For those new to automation, it’s recommended to start with smaller tasks that are easy to manage and can deliver quick wins. As you gain confidence, you can begin to tackle more complex processes. Here are a few ideas on types of tasks to automate:

* **High Volume Tasks**: Tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, like updating a large number of tickets.
* **Error-Prone Tasks**: Actions where mistakes are common, such as selecting incorrect fields.
* **Compliance Tasks**: Tasks that need to be performed consistently and reported on regularly.
* **Customer-Focused Tasks**: Repetitive requests from customers, such as password resets or adding users to groups.

### Action items

Write down a task that's ripe for automation. Make sure the task or process is possible to automate and get clear on your goal (whether it's to save time, reduce errors, and/or any of the other benefits you just learned about). This will help you apply key concepts from this course to a scenario that's relevant to your MSP!
