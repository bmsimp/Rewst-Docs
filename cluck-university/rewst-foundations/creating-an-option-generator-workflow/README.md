# Lesson 4: Creating an option generator workflow

## **What to Eggs-pect**

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Create an option generator workflow designed for a Rewst form field&#x20;
2. Use a data alias to store the "options" for a form field and accurately map those options in workflow output configuration
3. Create an API Request Action&#x20;
4. Update a Rewst form to use an Option Generator

### **Prerequisite(s)**

In this lesson, we review context data from the form and workflow that you create in "Building a Basic Form and Workflow."

### Keep On Cluckin'

We've created a workflow and set it up as an Option Generator to populate the group field with relevant groups, depending on whether the user is being added or removed from a group. In the next lesson, we'll complete the workflow to handle all group types.
