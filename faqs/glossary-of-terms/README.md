<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actions</td><td><strong>Actions</strong> are specific tasks that live inside a workflow in Rewst. Actions are grabbed from the menu, dragged onto the workflow UI, and executed as a task when the workflow runs.</td></tr><tr><td>API</td><td>Short for Application Programming Interface, an <strong>API</strong> is a set of protocols that allow actions on a platform in a programmatic manner. APIs power Rewst's integrations, enabling actions that workflows perform.</td></tr><tr><td>Automation</td><td><strong>Automation</strong> refers to the process of using technology, including Rewst's platform, to perform repetitive tasks without human intervention. It enables businesses to increase efficiency, accuracy, and consistency by automating various processes, from simple notifications to complex multi-step workflows.</td></tr><tr><td>Context Variables</td><td>Context Variables are variables accessed via the CTX prefix within a running workflow in Rewst, for dynamic processing.</td></tr><tr><td>Crate</td><td>A <strong>Crate</strong> is a pre-built automation. Crates within Rewst contain workflows, forms, triggers, templates, and scripts bundled together for easy deployment.</td></tr><tr><td>Crate Marketplace</td><td>The Rewst <strong>Crate Marketplace</strong> is the area of the Rewst platform where users can find and install Crates, offering a range of pre-built automation solutions.</td></tr></tbody></table>

| Filter | Specific to Rewst's extension of Jinja, filters are python functions surfaced in the platform and used to modify variables or expressions within a workflow, providing additional control over data processing.                                                                                |
| Form   | A **form** is a way to collect data within Rewst. Forms can contain static and dynamic fields to retrieve information, which is then passed into the workflow upon submission. End-users can be given Form URLs to fill out necessary information  prior to triggering a workflow's execution. |
|        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Template    | In Rewst, **templates** are used as a central store for repeated text, allowing for consistency across different actions and workflows.                                                                             |
| Transitions | **Transitions** are elements found at the bottom of every action in Rewst that determine the path the workflow will take. Transitions can be based on success, failure, always, or custom-defined Jinja conditions. |
| Triggers    | **Triggers** are components in Rewst used to initiate workflows or perform actions based on specific events or conditions. They can respond to various events, such as form submissions or webhook responses.       |
|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow | In the context of Rewst, a **workflow** is a series of automated actions that are executed in a specific sequence based on triggers and conditions. Workflows enable users to design, execute, and manage multi-step processes, bringing together various integrations to accomplish a particular task. |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
