# Templates and scripts

Templates and scripts are similar features in Rewst, though each is intended for a different purpose. Once created, they're separated by type into two sections in the platform for ease of organization and sorting. Both can be referenced in workflows.

## Templates

_Templates_ are used to create a standardized set of text used in several places in Rewst. For example, if you want to create a ticket and always use the same HTML for the ticket description, you would create a template. In the input, you would reference the template instead of having to type that same text each time.

To access templates, navigate to **Automations > Templates** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.

Write templates in either Markdown or HTML language.

### Create a template

1. Click **+ Create**.
2. Fill in the relevant fields with the information for your template.
   1. **Name**
   2. **Description**
   3. **Tags**
3. Select the language you want to write your template in from the **Language** drop-down selector.
4. Click into your **Editor** panel on the left side of the screen to begin writing. View your progress in the **Preview** panel.
5. Scroll down and click **Submit** when finished.

### Templates and Jinja

While templates are written in HTML or Markdown, they can accept small elements of Jinja to set up the use of templates elsewhere in Rewst. Templates allow for context variables to be set within them, which can then be referenced in workflows to allow the eventual sent message to populate with dynamic information.

In the example below, you're sending an e-mail to a new user that has been created.

```django
Hi {{ CTX.first_name }},

Welcome to Rewst!

Your email account has been provisioned and you should be able to access it at:
https://outlook.office.com/mail/

username: {{ CTX.email }}
password: {{ CTX.password }}

We're excited to have you on the team!
```

In the input for the `Send Mail` action, you would enter `{{ template("<template-id>")}}` into the action's **Message** field instead of typing out the intended message manually. This would pull your pre-written template into the body of the email when it is sent.

The template ID can be taken from the URL, when editing the template. As an example, let's look at the URL below.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 9.21.15 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The part of the URL underlined in yellow is the template ID. For this particular ID, your Jinja would read as `{{ template("768f5d45-5fe7-4c1f-b2c1-932dcbdcb1d7") }}`.

## Scripts

_Scripts_ in Rewst enable you to write scripts in a straightforward and accessible manner compared to traditional programming languages. Scripting tasks can range from batch processes on a local computer to generating dynamic web pages on a web server. Scripts can be written, edited, and executed more quickly and easily than software programs.

To access scripts, navigate to **Automations > Scripts** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.

Write Rewst scripts in any of the following languages: PowerShell, Python, YALM, Jinja.

### Create a script

1. Click **+ Create**.
2. Fill in the relevant fields with the information for your script.
   1. **Name**
   2. **Description**
   3. **Tags**
3. Select the language you want to write your script in from the **Language** drop-down selector.
4. Click into your **Text** panel to begin writing.&#x20;
5. Scroll down and click **Submit** when finished.
