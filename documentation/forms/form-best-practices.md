# Conditional fields

&#x20;You'll often have forms that you want to use across a multitude of clients, but sometimes fields may not be relevant to them all. Rewst has _conditional fields_ that can be used to determine whether you show another field.

In our example, we will look at the **Supervisor** field when creating a new user. In the image below, no Supervisor is set, and therefore the following field is another drop-down for further information.

You can then see that if we add content to that supervisor drop-down, which is a list of users pulled dynamically from Microsoft365, a new field appears.

This boolean field is then checked on, which gives access to another relevant field.

Rather than giving fields to a user that bear no relevance, you only give them fields they must fill in.

These conditional fields are set by clicking the field on the form and clicking **Set Conditional Field**, which presents you with the below.
