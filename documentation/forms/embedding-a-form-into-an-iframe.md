# Embed a form into an iFrame

### Embed forms

There is often a need to embed a form in an iframe to give users the ability to complete a form and trigger automation. The form can be embedded into other web pages that use iFrame links.

{% hint style="success" %}
To get the dynamic form URL, make sure your form is already set up as a trigger for a workflow.
{% endhint %}

### Get an embeddable link

Follow these steps to get the embeddable link:

1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows**.
2. Click on the Workflow that includes the form trigger.
3. Click **Edit Trigger** in the top menu.
4. Click on **Copy Embeddable iFrame code**.

This copies the embeddable Iframe code. Paste the code into your compatible webpage editor.
