# Rewst Dashboard

The Rewst Dashboard is the home screen you'll see when you first log into the platform. Click the drop-down organization selector in the top right to choose which org's information will be displayed in the dashboard at any given time.

Use the dashboard to easily digest key metrics for every workflow executed within a selected timeframe and better understand how Rewst is bringing you value. Identify usage patterns, success rates, and estimated time savings.

The top graph represents performance metrics with light blue bars, while the bottom graph shows time spent with purple bars. Both graphs have numeric values and axes, indicating various data points."><figcaption><p>The top of the Rewst Dashboard screen</p></figcaption></figure>

Choose to view the data in your desired timespan by clicking the relevant button at the top right of the dashboard for either **Weekly** or **Monthly** views. Note that the default for the dashboard timeline is monthly. Click **<** or **>** next to the indicated date to skip between date ranges. Click **Download CSV** to export the report to a file.

The **Tasks Performed** chart shows all tasks performed in the prior month or week for your selected organization.

The **Time Saved** chart shows the total time saved by using your Rewst automations in the prior month or week for your selected organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
This estimate is generated from the time saved number entered in your workflow's settings, as well as Rewst's baseline assumption of the manual effort required without automation for prebuilt automations like Crates. An estimate of zero means your estimate was never filled out. To resolve a zero estimate, navigate to the workflow and enter the time saved estimate there.
{% endhint %}

The **Workflows** menu shows stats for how many workflows in your selected time period were running, as well as how many executions were successful and how many errors were given. The time period selected at the top of your dashboard will determine the time period displayed in the widget.

Scroll further down the Rewst Dashboard page to see the **Workflows** widget.&#x20;

This section of the dashboard provides a centralized view of individual workflow usage metrics in separate columns: **Success Rate**, **Total Executions**, **Total Tasks**, and **Time Saved**. Click on any individual workflow in the widget's workflow list to open that workflow in the workflow builder canvas. Use the fields at the top of each column to enter search and filtering parameters to find your desired workflows. Click **Download CSV** to export the workflow data to a file.
