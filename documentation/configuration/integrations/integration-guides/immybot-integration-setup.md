# ImmyBot integration

{% hint style="info" %}

## What does the ImmyBot integration do?

Our ImmyBot integration enables the automation of remote machine management and monitoring. Use the ImmyBot API within Rewst workflows to gather detailed information and perform various operations on remotely managed machines, people, software, and scripts.

## Set up the ImmyBot integration

### Set up steps in ImmyBot

Before configuring the Rewst integration,  you'll need to get the application ID and client secret value from your ImmyBot account.

Please refer to [ImmyBot's Documentation](https://docs.immy.bot/azure-graph-permissions-setup.html) for up-to-date instructions on retrieving your API key information. Once you have the client secret, store the value somewhere safe. You'll need it for further set up steps in Rewst.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. Search for `ImmyBot` in the integrations page.\

3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. Enter your ImmyBot **Hostname**. Click **Next**.
5. Under **Azure App Registration**, enter the information copied from ImmyBot into the relevant fields:
   * **Microsoft Tenant ID** - The ID of the Microsoft 365 Tenant associated with your ImmyBot instance
   * **Application ID -** The Application ID of the Azure Enterprise App that Rewst will use to authenticate with ImmyBot
   * **Client Secret -** The Client Secret of the Azure app registration Rewst will use to authenticate with ImmyBot
6. Click **Next**.
7. Click the link that appears on the integration configuration screen to navigate to ImmyBot's Persons Settings. Create a new Person for Rewst to use. Use your primary Tenant, and set the AD External ID field value.
8. Click **Continue** to create your user and assign the admin Role.
9. Click **Test configuration**. If the integration is working properly, a green confirmation message will appear at the top of your screen.&#x20;
