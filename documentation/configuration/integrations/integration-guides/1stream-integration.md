## What does the 1Stream integration do?

## Set up the 1Stream integration

### Set up steps in 1Stream

5. Enter R`ewst Integration` into the **Reference Name** field in the **Add New Client Access API Key** dialog that appears.&#x20;
6. Click **Save**.
7. Copy the value given for the new **API Key** and store it someplace secure. You'll need it for further set up steps in Rewst. Once you navigate away from the dialog that displays this information, you won't be able to view the key again.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the Integrations page, search for the `1Stream` integration. \

3. Click on the integration tile to launch the **Configuration** setup page.
4. Enter the API Key copied from 1Stream into the **API Key** field.
5. Choose your relevant environment from the **Environment** drop-down selector.
   1. **Production -** if you're unsure which environment you have, choose Production
   2. **Sandbox -** this is a rare environment that will only apply to a few users who will know that they use Sandbox
6. Click **Save Configuration.**
7. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;
