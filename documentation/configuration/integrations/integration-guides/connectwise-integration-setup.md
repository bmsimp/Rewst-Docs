# ConnectWise PSA integration

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that ConnectWise PSA was previously known as ConnectWise Manage.

If you’re new to integrations in Rewst, read through our introductory integration documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations).
{% endhint %}

## What does the ConnectWise PSA integration do?

Our ConnectWise PSA integration enables the automation of PSA tasks. Use the ConnectWise PSA API within Rewst workflows to perform actions such as managing agreements, contacts, and tickets.

### Why use the ConnectWise PSA integration?

Here’s just a taste of what you can automate with relevant Crates, after you've set up your ConnectWise PSA integration:

* Add your child organizations, also known as customers, to Rewst.
* User onboarding and offboarding
* Categorize tickets using OpenAI

## Integration prerequisites

Rewst has a number of tasks that can be performed using the ConnectWise API, all of which require different permissions. You can review the [ConnectWise PSA Security Roles Matrix](https://developer.connectwise.com/@api/deki/files/422/Security_Roles_Matrix_11132017.xlsx?revision=1) for more information.

3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. In the **Configuration** form, enter the following into the relevant fields:
   1. The copied **API Member ID**
   2. The **company ID** used when logging into ConnectWise PSA
   3. The **Hostname** for ConnectWise PSA
   4. The private and public API key.
      1. Optionally, change the company query conditions to filter what companies are returned by the API.
   5. Add your own **client ID** - this is optional, but recommended. Instructions for how to find the client ID can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZZMM-ERFf0).
5. Click **Save Configuration**.
6. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Other configurations**

Once the integration has been configured within Rewst, we can use the Rewst Crate: Configure Organization Variables to configure your own custom settings and how Rewst should interact with ConnectWise PSA. Our Guide for that Crate can be found here: [_Configure Organization Variable_](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/existing-crate-documentation/configure-organization-variables)[_s_](../../../crates/existing-crate-documentation/configure-organization-variables.md)

Note that this form asks for information about your RMM / M365 settings as well. While this form can be completed again separately, we recommend that you also set up the integration for Microsoft Graph and your RMM at this same time.

## ConnectWise PSA pod configuration

{% hint style="warning" %}
Pod authorization

_Pods_ are a way to customize each of your screens in ConnectWise with relevant information that is often out of the view or displayed elsewhere in ConnectWise. Note that pods do not allow the use of the fat client due to authorization pass-through issues. This means that you can use the web client to access pods.
{% endhint %}

During pod configuration, you'll need to update your Rewst base URL to match your geographic Rewst instance. This will vary depending on which Rewst instance you are on. Identify your instance by the URL you use to access Rewst. Please use the following table as a guide to identify your Rewst base URL

| <p><br>Rewst URL</p> | Base URL           |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| app.rewst.io         | engine.rewst.io    |
| app.eu.rewst.io      | engine.eu.rewst.io |
| app.rewst.eu         | engine.rewst.eu    |
| app.rewst.asia       | engine.rewst.asia  |

### Configure ConnectWise pods <a href="#configure-connectwise-pods" id="configure-connectwise-pods"></a>

1. Login to ConnectWise PSA as a user that has access to the setup tables. This is likely an admin account.
2. Click **System** on the bottom left of the ConnectWise PSA UI.
3. Click the **Setup Tables** menu that appears.
4. Enter `*api` in the table filter. Your returned result should be **Manage Hosted API**.
5. Click **Add** and use the below settings:
   1. **Description** - Enter **Rewst**
   2. **Screen** - For our example, we use **Service Tickets**
   3. **Origin** - `<rewst_url>` Note that you'll need to update this origin URL to match your Rewst instance. Determine your instance by referencing the instance table above.
   4. **URL** - `https://<result_url>/organizations/<org_id>/integrations/embed/ticket/[cw_id]` Note that you'll need to update this URL to match your Rewst instance. Determine your instance by referencing the included instance table. You'll also need to add your own `org_id`to the URL. This can be obtained by going to your Rewst platform, looking at the URL, locating the org id between the / marks, and pasting it into the URL. `[cw_id]`should be left as-is.
6. Select **Pod**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Update the URL

You will need to add your own `rewst_url` and `org_id` to the URL above. Your Org ID can be obtained by going to Rewst and looking at the URL. `[cw_id]`should be left as-is.
{% endhint %}

### Add pods to tickets

1. Click the **Settings** icon in the top right corner of your screen.
2. Select **Pod Configuration**.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/cwm-pod-config.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Selecting the Settings Icon</p></figcaption></figure>

3. **Move** the Rewst pods to the **Displayed** table.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Firefox dynamic state partitioning**

An issue arises with Firefox's Dynamic State Partitioning where the default `network.cookie.cookieBehavior` value of 5 rejects (known) trackers and partitions third-party storage, hindering the authentication process and causing a logged GraphQL error. This issue also occurs with embedded forms.

Firefox users must set `network.cookie.cookieBehavior` to 4 for successful pod authentication.

Consult the official Firefox documentation for more information: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State\_Partitioning#disable\_dynamic\_state\_partitioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning#disable_dynamic_state_partitioning).\\
{% endhint %}

You'll have a workflow called `[Rewst Master v3] Pods: Technician Toolbox` within your organization.

### Re-run a pod from a ticket

Let's imagine you have a ticket that has had its associated pod workflow execution expire (or fail for one reason or another). If you attempt to view the pod in the ticket you'll see something along the lines of:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/RewstApp/docs.rewst.help/assets/121902974/7ce5ce24-e338-41a2-99d2-9db4effd218a" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To execute a new instance of the pod, click on the **Links** dropdown in the ticket and choose **Rewst - Start Pod on this Ticket**.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/RewstApp/docs.rewst.help/assets/121902974/058d6794-48ba-4f7d-b5ba-d15b2f295b87" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After you have used this button, a web page will open and close. This will send a request to the Live Link trigger and start a new execution for that ticket. Allow some time to pass for the ticket to update. You should see the pod populate once the execution has gone through.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/RewstApp/docs.rewst.help/assets/121902974/a1e209d6-c432-44aa-9785-14d24f47410f" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Query and filter in ConnectWise PSA actions

### Query string parameters and conditions

The ability to filter and query specific data is essential when working with ConnectWise PSA Actions in Rewst. Query string parameters and conditions let you use specific symbols and expressions to pinpoint the exact data you need.

#### **Build a query string**

Query strings are made up of three parts:

1. Attribute - This can be the name of the attribute you’re looking to filter on (eg: `name`), or it can be the path to get to the attribute you’re looking to filter on (eg: `board/name`).
2. Symbol - These define how you want to filter your incoming data. This can range from one-character symbols (eg: `=`), to entire words (eg: `contains`).
3. Value - This is what you’re actually looking for. This can be a wide range of data types including Strings (eg: `"hello world"`) and Booleans (eg: `True`)

These three parts can be combine to pull any data you need.

**Query conditions vs child conditions**

_Query conditions_ are used to find any value that can contain only one value, such as a string or a boolean. _Child conditions_ are used when the property you're filtering on contains many values, such as a list.

**Examples**

1. Easily locate companies by name
   1. Action: `List Companies`
   2. Query Condition: `name="Test Rewst"`
2. Organize tickets by board names for efficient processing
   1. Action: `List Service Tickets`
   2. Query Condition: `board/name="Integration"`
3. Target contacts based on communication preferences
   1. Action: `List Contacts`
   2. Child Condition: `communicationItems/value like "[john@Outlook.com](<mailto:john@Outlook.com>)" AND communicationItems/communicationType="Email"`

### **How to use symbols:**

* `=`: Matches exactly
* `!=`: Does not match
* `<, <=, >, >=`: Relational operators
* `contains, like, in, not`: Specific condition operators

### Practical examples

Learn how to apply query string parameters and conditions in real-world scenarios.

#### **Example 1: List Companies**

* **Action**: `List Companies`
* **Query Condition**: `name="Test Rewst"`
* **Explanation**: Easily locate companies by name.

#### **Example 2: List Service Tickets**

* **Action**: `List Service Tickets`
* **Query Condition**: `board/name="Integration"`
* **Explanation**: Organize tickets by board names for efficient processing.

#### **Example 3: List Contacts with Specific Communication Items**

* **Action**: `List Contacts`
* **Child Condition**: `communicationItems/value like "john@Outlook.com" AND communicationItems/communicationType="Email"`
* **Explanation**: Target contacts based on communication preferences.

### Query nested attributes

Accessing data within nested objects requires a specific approach.

* **Syntax**: Use a forward slash `/`
* **Example**: `communicationItems/value`
* **Use Case**: When you need to extract specific attributes from nested entities, such as communication items within contacts.

### Conditions in ConnectWise PSA actions

Different conditions serve different purposes. Mastering these conditions enables you to build complex and tailored queries.

* **Strings**: Match text patterns (`Summary = "string"`)
* **Integers**: Locate numerical values (`Board/Id = 123`)
* **Boolean**: Filter by true/false conditions (`ClosedFlag = True`)
* **Datetimes**: Sort by date and time (`LastUpdated = [2016-08-20T18:04:26Z]`)
* **Operators**: Define relational/logical conditions (`Summary Not Contains "Low Priority"`)
* **Logic Operators**: Combine multiple conditions (`AND, OR`)
* **Reference Conditions**: Access fields within referenced objects (`manufacturer/name`)
