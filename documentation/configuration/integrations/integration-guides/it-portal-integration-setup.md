## What does the ITPortal integration do?

Our ITPortal integration enables you to seamlessly update documentation.

## Set up the ITPortal integration

### Set up steps in ITPortal

1. Log in to ITPortal with your credentials.
2. Navigate to **Profile (name) > Admin Settings**.
3. Click **Generate API Key** under the **Security** section.
4. Select the option to **Generate API Key** under the **Security** section.

5. Enter a description for the API key. We recommend REWST.
6. Toggle the option **Allow to create same name objects** to off.
7. Click **Generate API Key**.
8.  Copy the new API key and store it somewhere secure. Once you leave this screen you won't be able to view the key again. You'll need this information for further steps in Rewst.

   2. Enter the **Base URL** from your ITPortal environment - e.g. demo.itportal.com
5. Click **Save Configuration**.
