# HaloPSA integration

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re new to integrations in Rewst, read through our introductory integration documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations).
{% endhint %}

## What does the HaloPSA integration do?

Our HaloPSA integration provides automation and workflow capabilities by connecting HaloPSA’s IT service management functions with Rewst’s automation platform. This integration allows users to manage and interact with various components of their PSA system directly from Rewst.

### Why use the HaloPSA integration?

#### **Automated ticket handling**&#x20;

A new support ticket is submitted in HaloPSA. A Rewst workflow can automatically classify the ticket, assign it to the correct team based on predefined criteria, and send an acknowledgment email to the customer.

#### **Asset management and tracking**

When a new asset is assigned to a client, update inventory records. Rewst can capture the asset details and update HaloPSA records, ensuring real-time inventory tracking.

#### **Client onboarding automation**

A new client signs a contract for IT services. Rewst can automatically create the client profile, set up relevant permissions, and initiate onboarding tasks.



## Integration prerequisites

* Access to the Rewst platform with administrative rights
* You must have a Halo administrator account.

## Set up the HaloPSA Integration

### Set up steps in HaloPSA

Before configuring the Rewst integration you must generate an API user. Here is the instruction for the generation of the integration user:

1. Log in to HaloPSA as an Administrator.
2. Navigate to **Configuration > Teams & Agents > Agents .**
3.  Click **+New**.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 10.40.25 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4. Create an agent for Rewst to use. We suggest naming this user `Rewst API` or similar.
5. Grant the user permissions according to what you would like Rewst to do for you. However, for optimal functionality and reliability of the Halo integration, assign administrator permissions to the service account. We’ve consistently observed higher success rates and fewer connectivity issues when using admin-level access for this integration. While lower permission levels may work in limited scenarios, they often lead to unexpected failures during automated workflows.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Navigate to **Configuration > Advanced > Integrations > HaloPSA API** \
   See [Halo Authorization Docs](https://halo.haloservicedesk.com/apidoc/authorisation) here.
8. Select **View Applications**.
9.  Click **+New**.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 10.43.40 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
10. Name the application `Rewst` .
11. Choose the authentication method for **Client ID and Secret (Services)**. Note that when you do this, new drop-down selectors will appear beneath the menu.
12. Ensure that **Agent to log in as** is set to **Rewst API**.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-18 at 4.28.27 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
13. Click the **Permissions** tab.
14. Check the **all** checkbox on.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 10.45.18 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
15. Click **Save**.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-18 at 4.26.42 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Teams & Agents > Agents**
2. Click on the user you set up for your Rewst integration.
3. Click the **Departments & Teams** tab.
4.  Click **Edit** on the top left. Within **Teams**, select **Add**.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 12.57.22 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
5. Add all teams from the **Team** drop-down selector.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 12.58.11 PM.png>)
6. Click **Save**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Required for mapping customers in the Integration**

When creating the API Agent, ensure that the **Allow use of all Customers** Client Restriction setting is set to **Yes** if you want to allow Rewst to interact with your customer records.
{% endhint %}

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the integrations page, search for `HaloPSA`.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-11 at 4.50.15 PM.png>)
3. Click on the integration tile to launch the **Configuration** setup page.
4. Fill out the form with the details you created:
   1. **Client ID**: Fill in the ID for the application registered in HaloPSA.
   2. **Client Secret**: Fill in the authentication secret for the application registered in HaloPSA.
   3. **Resource Server Hostname**: HaloPSA Resource Server hostname, e.g. `example.halopsa.com`.
   4. **Auth Server Hostname**: HaloPSA Auth Server hostname, e.g. `example.halopsa.com/auth,` if different from the Resource Server Hostname.
   5. **Is On-Premise?**: Clarify whether or not the HaloPSA instance is hosted on an on-premise server.
   6. **Tenant ID**: When using a cloud-hosted Halo PSA instance, this must be specified. This value can be found in the HaloPSA web application under **Configuration > Integrations > HaloPSA API > API Details**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Resource Server Hostname and Auth Server Hostname must be in the correct format. Incorrect formatting will lead to setup failure.

Note that the links copied from HaloPSA contain https:// at their start. You'll need to remove this from the link before pasting into fields in Rewst. For the Resource server, you'll also need to remove the end of the link, /api. See the below example.

Resource Server Hostname: `https://sanboxrewst.halopsa.com/api` should be `sandboxrewst.halopsa.com`

Auth Server Hostname: `https://sanboxrewst.halopsa.com/auth` should be `sanboxrewst.halopsa.com/auth`&#x20;
{% endhint %}

5. Click **Save Configuration**.
6. &#x20;Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;

## Test the integration

1. Navigate to **Automation > Workflows** in Rewst.
2. Create a new workflow and name it with something short and descriptive, such as `Test Halo Integration`.
3. Add the action **List Agents** to the workflow builder canvas, by dragging it from the left pane.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21) (1).png>)
4. Add a trigger to your test workflow by clicking on the /lightning bolt image. Name your trigger whatever you’d like.
5. Click into the trigger’s settings.
6. Toggle **Enabled** to on.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (1).png>)
7. Set the **Trigger Type** to **Core - Always Pass**.
8. Click **+** next to **Integration Overrides**. Add **Halo PSA** as your integration override.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (24) (1).png>)
9. In the **Activate Trigger To Run For** section, keep **Selected Organization** toggled on. **Toggle All current and future managed organizations** on, or choose just one or individually selected organizations from the **Organizations** drop-down selector.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1).png>)
10. Click **Submit** to save your trigger.
11. Click **Publish** to save your changes.
12. Click Test to run your workflow. Note that this will bring up a drop-down selector to choosing organizations.
13. Select your MSP level.
14. Click **Test** and confirm that the execution finishes without errors.\
    ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (1).png>)
15. If the test for your MSP is successful, do the same test again. At this point in your steps, select a client organization instead, and ensure that it finishes with no errors.

{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Customers are not showing up when refreshing options</summary>

Customers not showing when refreshing options is due to an issue with permissions. Make sure to check that both the user and API user have the following permissions, at minimum:

* View Customers
* View Support Tickets
* Add Time Entries
* Create Support Tickets

{% hint style="warning" %}
You may need to uninstall and reinstall the Halo integration for the new permissions to take place.&#x20;
{% endhint %}



</details>

<details>

<summary>Boards and teams are not visible in configure organizational variable form</summary>

If you can't see boards or teams in the configure organizational variable form, this is due to incorrect permissions. You’ll need to add the API User to the teams that you want to see in the form.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Email, name, department is missing or CAB ID is invalid</summary>

If you run into an issue where the Email, Name, Department, or other information is missing, or you see that the CAB ID is either invalid or mandatory, this is due to custom fields used in creating tickets. To use these custom ticket fields:

* The Custom Field IDs need to be added as an organization variable
* The Custom Field should not be marked as mandatory

</details>

<details>

<summary>New User Onboarding and Offboarding Crate Halo Issues</summary>

Rewst only uses the bare minimum of fields for ticket creation in these Crates.

#### Ticket Creation

* team
* source
* summary
* user\_id
* client\_id
* site\_name
* status\_id
