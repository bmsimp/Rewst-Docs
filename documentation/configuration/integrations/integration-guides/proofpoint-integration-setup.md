1. Log in to your Proofpoint portal.
2. Navigate to **Account Management > Integrations > Security Integrations > Proofpoint API**.
3. Generate an **API Password**.&#x20;
4. Copy the password and store it somewhere secure. You'll need this information for further set up steps in Rewst.

4. Enter the following information into the relevant fields under **Parameters**:
   1. **Domain**: Your primary domain in ProofPoint
   2. **Username**: ProofPoint API Username - this must be a channel admin user in ProofPoint
   3. **Proofpoint API Password**: The generated API password
   4. **Tenant Hostname**: the regional tenant hostname
5. Click **Save Configuration**.
6. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;
