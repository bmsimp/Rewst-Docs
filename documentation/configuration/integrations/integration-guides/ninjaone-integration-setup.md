# NinjaOne integration

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re new to integrations in Rewst, read through our introductory integration documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations).
{% endhint %}

## What does the NinjaOne integration do?

Our NinjaOne integration provides users with a powerful combination of documentation, remote monitoring, and management capabilities. Seamlessly access and manage NinjaRMM within Rewst, monitor and troubleshoot devices, deploy software, and perform remote tasks more effectively. Use this integration to centralize your IT documentation and RMM workflows, ensuring a comprehensive and streamlined approach to IT management within the Rewst platform.

### Why use the NinjaOne integration?

* Device monitoring and management
* Execute scripts on endpoints
* Deploy software to devices

## Set up the NinjaOne Integration

### Set up steps in NinjaOne

1. Navigate to **Administration > Library > Automation**.
2. Click **Add**, then **New Script**.
3. Add the following script:
   1. Name: Rewst (Windows)
   2. Language: Powershell
   3. OS: Windows
   4. Architecture: All
   5. Paste the code below into the script box

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Rewst Base URL will vary depending on which Rewst instance you are on. You must update the $rewst\_base\_url property in the script below to match your Rewst Instance. You can identify which instance you are on by the URL you use to access Rewst. Please use the following table as a guide to identify your Rewst Base URL
{% endhint %}

| Rewst URL       | Base URL           |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| app.rewst.io    | engine.rewst.io    |
| app.eu.rewst.io | engine.eu.rewst.io |
| app.rewst.eu    | engine.rewst.eu    |
| app.rewst.asia  | engine.rewst.asia  |

```powershell
Param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$script_content_path,
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$results_postdata_path
)

$rewst_base_url = "https://INSERTBASEURLHERE/webhooks/custom/action"
$script_content_url = "$rewst_base_url/$script_content_path"
$post_url = "$rewst_base_url/$results_postdata_path"



# Download Script Content from Rewst

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$wc.Encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$commands = ($wc.DownloadString($script_content_url))

# Execute Script Content

iex $commands
```

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (37) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
5. Authorize OAuth into NinjaOne, via Microsoft. You should see your customer show up at the bottom. You may need to click **Refresh Options** for customers to populate.
6. Click **Save Configuration**.
7. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For APAC customers:

* When you click **Authorize** during the set up process, you end up at the URL [https://app.ninjarmm.com/auth/](https://app.ninjarmm.com/auth/).&#x20;
* If you change the **Region Instance** to APAC and click **Authorize**, you may still be redirected to the US site.
* Click **Save Configuration** first. Then, reload Ninja's website and ensure that it's showing the correct APAC region.
* Click **Authorize** again. The URL should now show the correct APAC address.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Test the integration

Once you’ve [mapped your customers](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/general/organization-mapping#what-is-organization-mapping), test the integration by following the steps below.

1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Name your workflow, and click **Submit**.
4. Drag a Ninja action onto your workflow builder canvas. In this example, we use **List Contacts**.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (38) (1).png>)
5. Click <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-21 at 11.13.39 AM (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> to add a trigger. In the relevant fields, choose or enter the following settings:
   1. **Name** your trigger
   2. **Trigger Type**: **Core - Always Pass**
   3. **Integration Overrides**: **NinjaRMM**
   4. **Enable** the trigger for all or some of your managed organizations, depending on your setup and preference
6.  Click **Submit**.\
    \

7. Click **Test**, and select a company to run the action for. Test a handful of companies to ensure the integration is working.

## Use custom PowerShell scripts with your RMM integration

This brand of RMM allows PowerShell scripts to be passed via API. To report the script back to Rewst, you'lll need to add a manual webhook action. We recommend using the run PowerShell script subworkflow to handle this for you and if using custom scripts you will need to add this to bottom to ensure the call back to Rewst is made.

```
$postData = $PS_Results | ConvertTo-Json Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri $post_url -Body $postData -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
```

## Troubleshoot the NinjaOne integration

### All List component actions fail.

If any list action is failing, ensure that you have added the script in previous instructions, into NinjaOne.
