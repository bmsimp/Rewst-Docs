# Add a new client via Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider

{% hint style="success" %}
For a more streamlined process for adding new clients, see our [add-client-to-rewst-setup.md](../../../../crates/existing-crate-documentation/add-client-to-rewst-setup.md "mention") setup page.
{% endhint %}

## Step one: Create client in Rewst

The first part of adding a client is to create them within Rewst itself. The easiest way to do this is to add them via the [Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle](./), which contains Rewst's CSP Integration.&#x20;

1. Navigate on the left navigation menu to **Configuration > Integrations > Microsoft CSP**_._ You'll see a list of your clients on the left, which you can filter using the column header options across the top.

2. Find the empty drop-down field under **Rewst Organization**. Enter a name. Note that this is the name of the organization within Rewst. We recommend you match this with the company in the PSA to make it more quickly identifiable.&#x20;
3. Click ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-07 at 2.00.23â€¯PM (1) (1).png>) to the right of the drop-down.
4. Click **Submit**. The drop-down will auto-fill with the client you created.

## Step two: Match organization to other apps

The second step is matching the organization you created to the various companies in your other applications, such as your PSA and RMM.

Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform. Click through each installed integration.

On the right-hand side, you will see an empty dropdown for the org you made. You can either:

1. Click **Suggest Matches**, which will attempt to fuzzy match the org name. Make any necessary changes.
2. Click **Save Mappings**.
3. Manually work through each empty drop-down and select the relevant company in the integration.&#x20;
4. Click **Save Mappings**.

Once you have done this for each integration, you can start building workflows for those clients. Note that there is however some additional work to do if you are adding clients to existing workflows or forms, such as the New User Onboarding workflow.

## Step Three: Recommended - set up organization variables for client

This is a recommended step for any new client and includes setting up organization variables for the client.&#x20;

Navigate to **Forms > \[ROC] Rewst: Simple Organizational Variable Form for Child Accounts > Options Menu > Usages > View Direct URLs**.

Select the URL for the organization you added.

Our recommended fields to fill in are:

1. **Primary Identity Provider**
2. **Username Format**
3. **Preferred Domain Controller -** this is only a required field if you're using Ninja right now
4. **Preferred ADConnect Server** - this is only a required field  if you're using ADConnect
