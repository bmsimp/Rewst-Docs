# Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle

{% hint style="warning" %}
Rewst's previous setup for Microsoft was separate integrations for each Microsoft app. If you are an older Rewst customer and have not yet migrated from our individual integration to bundle configuration, please see the below section for how to [Migrate to the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle.](./#migrate-legacy-microsoft-integrations-to-the-new-microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## What is the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle?

The Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle is Rewst’s solution for integrating your most common Microsoft tools. It’s a little different from our other integrations in that we group multiple integrations together, by brand, to allow for easier and more custom integration options during setup.

{% hint style="info" %}
Though you’ll be working from one integration menu tile to set up all integrations, each integration will appear as its own section with its own actions in the actions list of the workflow builder.

For detailed permission breakdown for all Microsoft integrations in the bundle, see our separate documentation [here](microsoft-cloud-permissions.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Why use the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle?

* Customize permissions tailored to your organization’s needs.
* Centralize the management of all Microsoft integrations through the Rewst platform.
* Protect your data with enhanced security measures.
* Keep your integrations current with continuous updates and enhancements.

## **What integrations are in the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle?**

You'll be prompted to check off any or all of the following integrations to be included in your setup process. The Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle contains integrations for:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-24 at 3.36.15 PM (1).png" alt="&#x22;Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle” setup interface. At the top, icons represent Rewst, a link, and Microsoft Cloud. A progress bar shows four steps: 1) Select Integrations, 2) Configuration Parameters, 3) Tenant Permissions, and 4) Authorize Integrations, with step 1 highlighted. The main section lists integration options with checkboxes: Microsoft Graph (checked, required), Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft CSP, and Microsoft Azure. Each option includes its logo and a description of what the integration enables. At the bottom right, there is a turquoise “Next” button. The interface has a dark background with white text."><figcaption><p>The <strong>Select Integrations</strong> screen of the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle's configuration process</p></figcaption></figure>

1. **Microsoft Graph:** A unified API that provides a single endpoint for accessing and managing data and intelligence across Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility and Security.\
   :point\_right: You should check this box to install the integration to allow Rewst to make API calls. This is necessary for the bundle to work.
2. **Microsoft Exchange Online:** The cloud-hosted version of the traditional Microsoft Exchange Server, offering similar functionalities but without the need for on-premises server infrastructure.\
   :point\_right: You should check this box to install the integration to allow you to send Exchange Online PowerShell commands.
3. **Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)**: This allows for the resale of Microsoft cloud services like Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 to businesses, often with added value services. It's a subscription-based model where MSPs can bill customers.\
   :point\_right: You should check this box if you use the Microsoft Partner Center and want to run Rewst actions against your customer tenants.
4. **Microsoft Azure**: A cloud computing platform, Azure offers a range of cloud infrastructure services, including computing, analytics, storage, networking, and AI. Note that Microsoft formerly called a different tool Azure, and renamed that tool Microsoft Entra.\
   :point\_right: You should check this box to install the integration if you are already an Azure user and have an existing [Azure key vault ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts)set up with Microsoft. If you don't have a key vault, you'll need to create an empty one to complete bundle setup, then check this box. Instructions for how to do this can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal).

## Set up the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle

{% hint style="info" %}
We've broken down instructions into three  larger steps, each with its own section. Read through the entire process before starting step 1 to familiarize yourself with what will be needed.

Click each expander to open and view that substep's instructions and information.
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Create a Microsoft service account in Microsoft Entra

{% hint style="info" %}
To set up Rewst integration, you'll need a new service account that has Global Admin settings. Once the integration has been completed, this can be removed. If you need to uninstall and re-integrate the integration, however, and you've removed the Global Admin settings, you'll need to recreate this before reintegrating.
{% endhint %}

{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary>Modify conditional access policy in Microsoft Azure</summary>

#### Set up your MSP's policies

{% hint style="info" %}
This step is unnecessary if the tenant is under Microsoft default security settings. If you have no conditional access policies and are operating under security defaults, which already require MFA, skip to the next section.
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to the [Conditional Access Policies](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies) blade in Azure.
2. Remove the Rewst service account from any existing policies which may have been inherited at the time of its creation. If there are no existing policies, move on to the next step.
3. Create a New Policy.
   * **Include Rewst User**: Add the Rewst user to the policy
   * **Enforce MFA**: Mandate Azure Multi-factor Authentication for each login and application if you have not done so already
   * **Policy Name**: Save this policy under the name `Rewst Conditional Access Policy`

#### Set up your Client's policies

Granular access is influenced by your clients' [conditional access policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview). To ensure seamless access to your clients using your Rewst integration user, follow these steps

1. Navigate to your client's [Conditional Access Policies](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies) blade in Azure.
2. &#x20;For each policy listed, add an exclusion to **Users and Groups** with these settings:
   * Guest or external users
   * Service Provider Users
   * **Tenant ID**: Enter your tenant ID. If unknown, find it at [What Is My Tenant ID](https://whatismytenantid.com/).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: Excluding the MSP from the Conditional Access Policy is recommended as per [Microsoft's GDAP Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/gdap-faq#what-is-the-recommended-next-step-if-the-conditional-access-policy-set-by-the-customer-blocks-all-external-access-including-csps-access-aobo-to-the-customers-tenant).

**Post-modification behavior**

* **Propagation time**: Changes may take up to an hour to become active in the Rewst environment.
* **Quick refresh**: Click the blue shield icon next to the client's name on the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle page in Rewst to expedite propagation.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Register the enterprise app and authorize the Rewst integration

<details>

<summary>Register the enterprise app</summary>

1.  Choose how to register the app.



    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-18 at 3.16.36 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. Most users should select the Rewst-created enterprise app. It simplifies setup, includes the required permissions, and is secure. Unless you’re absolutely sure you need your own, choose the default option.
    2. If you are absolutely certain that you must bring your own app rather than using the Rewst-created one, choose this registration option. Owned app registration instructions can be found here: [https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/configuration/integrations/integration-guides/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle/owned-app-registration](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/configuration/integrations/integration-guides/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle/owned-app-registration)
    3. Click **Next**.
2.  Set permissions for Microsoft Graph.



    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-12 at 4.08.52 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1. You can pick and choose from a set of pre-selected Graph permissions, or edit based on your org’s security preferences.
    2. These permissions are carefully chosen to support Crates without authentication issues.
    3. If you modify permissions from the stock ones suggested by Rewst, it’s your responsibility to verify that your custom permissions don’t interfere with Rewst’s functionality.
    4. For more detail, consult Microsoft Graph’s [official permissions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).
    5. Microsoft can take up to 48 hours for all scopes to appear in the Rewst integration. If scopes are not appearing for you, pause integration setup, and return later to allow time for Microsoft to update.
3. Grant additional access for other Microsoft integrations
   1. Exchange, CSP, and Azure, if needed, are simpler and allow you to toggle access as desired.
   2. Microsoft Graph includes \~177 APIs, and gives you broad access to users, groups, and licensing from one endpoint.
4. Click **Next**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Authorize Rewst</summary>

1. Review your configuration decisions in the **Authorize Integrations** screen. Click **Back** f you wish to make updates. Click **Authorize** when satisfied with your choices.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-08-12 at 4.12.50 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. After authorizing, you’ll see:
   1. What authorized successfully
   2. Which user was used
   3. The tenant ID
   4. A corresponding Enterprise App created in Entra

</details>

### Step 3: Link your customers to Rewst child organizations

{% hint style="info" %}
This section covers the different ways you can set up your child organizations. Please read through the entire section before beginning, to determine which of the situational steps are right for you.  How you complete this step will depend on the way you choose to use Rewst: If you're unsure of which of these situations apply to you, contact Rewst Support for assistance.\
\
If you are part of the Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and have access to GDAP, follow the instructions below to configure GDAP before linking customers.
{% endhint %}

#### What is GDAP and why is it important to the setup process?

In 2024, Microsoft moved away from regular user-based access, where users logged into Microsoft Entra with an individually permissioned account. Instead, they now operate via delegated admin permissions, where permissions are assigned from the top level down, for more secure access management. This is known as _Granulated Delegated Admin Permissions_, or _GDAP_.

As part of the bundle setup process, you were asked to create a dedicated user to act as your Microsoft service account. The way this is done and the roles you adopt are important, as GDAP dictates that this will now have a direct effect on how Rewst interacts with Microsoft.

For example, let’s say that 12 roles map to 177 permissions.

* Rewst will try to make an API call.
* The enterprise app will look for permissions.
* The enterprise app will ask if it is making the call at customer level, and if there are roles at the customer level.

#### Click to expand instructions and choose your situation from these three methods&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Link customers using GDAP - CSP Partners: Rewst-recommended option for setting up GDAP</summary>

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are part of the Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and have access to GDAP, follow the instructions below to configure GDAP before linking customers.
{% endhint %}

1. Unpack the [Rewst Microsoft GDAP Assistant Crate](../../../../crates/existing-crate-documentation/rewst-microsoft-gdap-assistant-crate.md). This will create the relationship and generate a link for your customer to accept the relationship. Once the customer manually accepts, you'll be given a second link to kick off another workflow that adds all groups to the relationship, and maps them to the relevant roles.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (331).png>)<br>
2. Return to your Rewst platform. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations > Microsoft Cloud Bundle**.
3. Use the **organization mapping** menu that appears at the bottom of the screen to choose the customer organizations you wish to map the bundle to.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-11 at 12.21.58 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Click **consent** next to your organization to consent for just that customer. Alternatively, click <img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-11 at 12.23.48 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to consent to delegated admin permissions for all linked customers. If you haven't completed GDAP set up for all customers, this button will fail on the uncompleted customers.
4. Check for each of your organizations to ensure that the consent process was successful.&#x20;
   1. A green shield to the right of the integration name means the GDAP relationship is working and API access is valid.
   2. A blue shield or error means setup failed, and permissions are missing or incorrectly configured.



</details>

<details>

<summary>Link customers using GDAP without using the Rewst Microsoft GDAP Assistant Crate</summary>

Follow these instructions to set up GDAP relationships without the Rewst Microsoft GDAP Assistant Crate. Note that Rewst recommends using the Crate if possible, for a better setup experience.

#### Assign the security group to the service account user you created previously&#x20;

1. Navigate to **Manage > Groups**. Click **+New Group**.
   1. Choose **security group** as the group type.&#x20;
   2. Name the group `Rewst GDAP-[ROLE NAME]`.
   3. Enter `for SCP GDAP role assignment` as the description.
   4. Choose **Yes** for **Microsoft Entra roles can be assigned to the group**.
   5. Add the Rewst user you created in the previous steps as a member of the group.
   6. Click **Create**.
   7. Click **Yes** in the dialog that appears.
2. You will need to complete step 1 a total of 12 times, to create 12 security groups, each named differently to indicate the role it is associated with. For example, `Rewst GDAP-[NEXT ROLE NAME]`, etc.
3. Wait for the status to change to **Active**. Note that this can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours depending on Microsoft's response time.&#x20;

#### Assign recommended roles for GDAP

1. Navigate to [partner.microsoft.com](http://partner.microsoft.com) and sign in.
2. Click **Partner Center > Customers > Customer List**.\

## Manage your organizations that have been registered with enterprise apps in Rewst

If you’d like to manage your internal organization with Rewst and enable it to run automations, you’ll need to assign specific roles to your Rewst service account. If you don't want to manage your internal MSP, you can remove the Global Administrator Role now.  If you wish to continue managing your MSP organization, add the 12 roles indicated below to the Rewst service account. Then, remove the Global Administrator Role.  Removing the role will not remove the 12 added roles.

* If you used the Rewst Microsoft GDAP Assistant Crate to set up your GDAP roles, you'll still need to manually add these roles to your Rewst service account. The Crate does not add them at the MSP parent organization level for you.
* If you chose to set up the GDAP roles manually without using the Crate, you'll also need to manually add these roles to your Rewst service account. Note that they're the same 12 roles that you used previously.

Once this has been completed, you can remove the Global Administrator Role from your Service account

{% hint style="warning" %}
Important: Review your internal processes before proceeding, as Rewst will be able to make changes to your organization once these roles are applied.
