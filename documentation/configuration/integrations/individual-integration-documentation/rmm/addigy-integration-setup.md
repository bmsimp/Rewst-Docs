## What does the Addigy integration do?

Our Addigy integration enables the automation of Apple device management and monitoring. Use the Addigy API within Rewst workflows to create, read, update, or delete managed devices, and access monitoring functionality.

## Set up the Addigy integration

### Set up steps in Addigy

1. Log in to your Addigy account.
2. Navigate to [https://app.addigy.com/integrations](https://app.addigy.com/integrations).
3. Scroll down the page to the **Addigy API** submenu.
4. Click the **V2** tab.
5. Click **New API Token**.
6. Set your appropriate name and permissions for your V2 API token.
7. Click **Add**.
8. Copy the v2 token value from the new token section of the V2 tab. Store it somewhere secure, as you'll need it for further steps in Rewst. Note that once you leave this page, you won't be able to see the token again.
9.  Copy the **Parent Organization ID**. This will be displayed under the **Addigy API** submenu title.\

3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. **Under Parameters, paste the information copied from Addigy into the relevant fields:**
   1. **Parent Organization ID**
   2. **V1 Client ID**
   3. **V1 Client Secret**
   4. **V2 API Key**
5. Click **Save Configuration.**&#x20;
6. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;
