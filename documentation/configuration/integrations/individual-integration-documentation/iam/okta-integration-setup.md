# Okta integration setup

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re new to integrations in Rewst, read through our introductory integration documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations).

## Set up the Okta integration

### Set up steps in Okta

1. Log in to the Okta Admin Console. You'll need to have administrator privileges to be able to create API tokens.
2. Navigate to **Security** **> API** in the left side menu.
3. Click **Tokens**.
4. Click **Create Token**.
5. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Create token** dialog. This will help you to identify the token later.
6. Click **Create Token**.
7. The token value will be displayed in a new dialog. You will need this value to authenticate your API calls in Rewst. Make sure to copy the token value and store it in a secure location. You will not be able to view the token value again after you close the dialog box.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. Search for `Okta` in the integrations page.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.40.19 PM.png>)
3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. Under **Parameters**:
   1. Enter the copied key value into the **API Key** field.
   2. Enter your hostname.
5. Click **Save Configuration**.

We'll perform a quick test to ensure that the connection to Okta is working as expected. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;
