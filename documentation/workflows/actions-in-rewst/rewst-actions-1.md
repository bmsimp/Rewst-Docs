# Workflows actions

## Available workflows actions

The **Workflows** actions accordion menu contains any existing workflows in the workflow list for the related child organization. This actions menu is what powers Rewst's [subworkflow](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/workflows/different-types-of-workflows#subworkflow) functionality, by letting you reuse existing workflows as individual tasks in a more broadly scoped integration.&#x20;

The available actions in this submenu will be different for each of your child organizations. Each time you create a new workflow, the list will grow.

Unpacking a Crate will also add the workflows in that Crate to the Workflows actions accordion menu. You'll gain many of the common automations our team has pre-built workflows for, and can use them to build your own custom workflows.

Note that most workflows actions will use [input variables](../data-input-and-output-input-variables-and-context-variables.md). If present, these will appear in the **Parameters** tab of the task.&#x20;
