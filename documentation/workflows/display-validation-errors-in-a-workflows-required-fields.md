In the top right corner of your workflow builder screen, you'll find the **Display Validation Errors** toggle. By default, it's set to off, but it can be toggled on as desired.

This toggle will provide an error on required fields they aren't filled out, and add a message about the field being required beneath the field in red text. The text will be invisible until the user clicks on the field and then click out of it without entering a value.
