# Attach multiple forms to a workflow

A workflow can be called by multiple forms through the use of triggers. All that is required is to open the workflow and create a new trigger with 'Core - Form Submission' selected for the _Trigger Type_.

For more information on triggers, please read our [introductory triggers documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/mdGoyUomPKsvu1TSazxc/s/AQQ1EHVcEsGKBPVHmiav/~/changes/1274/documentation/intro-to-triggers).

For more information on forms, please read our [Intro to Forms](../forms/) page.
