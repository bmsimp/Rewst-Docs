# Use webhook triggers

## What is a webhook trigger?

_Webhook triggers_ are an effective way to kick off a workflow with context from external systems. By sending an API request to a webhook trigger, Rewst will fire the workflow and include any data and or queries included in the request.

### **Anatomy of a webhook URL**

Webhook URLs are formatted consistently using the trigger ID and organization ID. The format is as follows: `https://engine.rewst.io/webhooks/custom/trigger/{{ Trigger ID }}/{{ Organization ID }}`

Using this information, you can craft webhook links on the fly for organizations where a webhook trigger is enabled. This may be useful for invoking certain workflows using links in a PSA ticket note or email, for example

## Create the workflow

In the Rewst platform:

1. Navigate to **Workflows > Create**.
2. Enter a workflow name, like `My First Webhook Trigger`.
3. Click **Submit** to proceed to a blank workflow creation screen.
4. Add a single [no-op](../../actions-in-rewst/core-actions.md#no-operation-noop) action to the canvas. Name it `BEGIN`
5. Click **Publish** to save your workflow. No other actions are needed, as you'll just be working with triggers.
6. Click **Add Trigger** at the top of your workflow builder.

## **Set trigger parameters**

The following parameters are available for editing:

* **Allowed methods**
  * Used to define which HTTP request method is accepted by the trigger. Attempting to send a request with a method not in this list will result in an error
* **Include raw body**
  * Whether to include the raw string sent in the request body in the results as `raw_body`
* **Response body**
  * Content to return in response body. \{{ REQUEST \}} may be used to access request data.
* **Response headers**
  * HTTP headers to include in response. \{{ REQUEST \}} may be used to access request data.
  * **TIP:** Set your content type here if returning a specific format of data, such as `text\html`
* **Response status**
  * HTTP status to return in response. \{{ REQUEST \}} may be used to access request data.
* **Secret key**
  * Required to Wait For Results. This value must be included in the header as x-rewst-secret when making calls to this webhook. You will receive a 401 if this field is filled out and the secret key is not provided when making the request. Secrets can be defined in the Organization Variables section of the UI
* **Wait for results**
  * If true, calls to the trigger endpoint will redirect to a results endpoint that will return the output of the workflow.

## **Access data in a webhook trigger request**

When a webhook receives a request, it will include data received in the following schema:

```json
{
    body:{},
    headers:{},
    method:"",
    params:{},
    timestamp:""
}
```

Data can then be pulled from this as context variables. For example, to access the value for `test` sent to the webhook as:

```json
{
    "test": "Hello, World!"
}
```

The value can be accessed at `{{ CTX.body.test }}`.

Similarly, if a URL parameter is sent as `?test=Hello`, this can be accessed at `{{ CTX.params.test }}`
