# \[REWST - TASK] M365/On-Prem: Gather User Details

This workflow functions as a critical automation building block that retrieves comprehensive user information from both Microsoft 365 and on-premises Active Directory environments, serving as a foundation for more complex user management automations. For MSPs, this workflow is particularly valuable in hybrid environment management scenarios, including user onboarding/offboarding processes, troubleshooting access issues, and preparing documentation for compliance auditsâ€”all without requiring technicians to manually query multiple systems. Technically, the workflow validates input parameters, determines whether to query cloud or on-premises environments (or both), leverages Microsoft Graph API for cloud data, executes PowerShell via RMM for on-premises information, and then formats everything into standardized output that can be consumed by other workflows or ticketing systems.

This workflow contains 10 tasks.

### Inputs

* **rmm\_site** - string
  * Provide the RMM site ID (optional)
* **aad\_user\_guid** - string
  * Please provide the Entra/AzureAD user's unique GUID
* **on\_prem\_upn\_or\_sam** - string
  * Please provide the on prem AD user's UPN or samAccountName

### Outputs

* **automation\_log**: Standardized Rewst automation log
* **success**: Boolean; States if workflow was successful.
* **output**: Dictionary object containing an azure\_user dictionary (if applicable) and on\_prem\_user dictionary (if applicable). These objects will contain information about the user.
