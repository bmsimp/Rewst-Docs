# \[REWST - TASK] Remove Group Memberships

This workflow automatically removes users from both Microsoft 365 and on-premises Active Directory groups, functioning as a critical building block in comprehensive user management automations like offboarding, permission adjustments, or security remediation processes. MSPs will find this particularly valuable during client offboarding processes, security incident responses requiring immediate access revocation, compliance audits, and multi-tenant management scenarios where maintaining accurate group memberships across different environments is challenging. Technically, the workflow retrieves the user's current group memberships via Microsoft Graph API, evaluates whether to process cloud-based groups (Microsoft 365) or on-premises Active Directory groups (or both), and then executes the removals using appropriate methods for each environmentâ€”API calls for cloud groups and PowerShell commands via RMM for on-premises groups.

This workflow contains 12 tasks.

### Inputs
