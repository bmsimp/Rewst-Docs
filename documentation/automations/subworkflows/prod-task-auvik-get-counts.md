# \[PROD - TASK] Auvik: Get Counts

This workflow serves as a foundational building block that retrieves and quantifies all network devices tracked in Auvik across your client base, providing essential inventory metrics that can be leveraged in reporting, billing automation, or compliance verification processes. For MSPs, this function delivers critical visibility when performing quarterly business reviews, validating managed device counts against service agreements, or identifying growth opportunities within existing clients' networks. Technically, the workflow first retrieves all tenant details from Auvik, then calls a device listing task for each tenant, and finally merges these device counts with company information to produce comprehensive device statistics by client - all accessible via API for integration with your PSA, documentation system, or custom reporting tools.

This workflow contains 7 tasks.
