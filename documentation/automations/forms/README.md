# Forms

## What is a form?

In Rewst, every automation starts with a single click. _Forms_ are powerful tools used to collect the information your workflows need to start. They streamline the data collection process by gathering key details from users such as names, dates, or options. Forms can be manually created, or added as part of [Crate unpacking](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/crates#unpack-a-crate).&#x20;

Rewst's form functionality is designed to empower users with the tools to build interactive, responsive, and customizable forms.&#x20;

## Why use forms?

Forms collect data in one simple step, reducing manual data entry and saving you time. They can also function as triggers in Rewst when building workflows, allowing for seamless transitions and increased efficiency.&#x20;

Expand the reach of your forms by embedding them into various web pages, providing increased accessibility to users. Tailor forms to specific scenarios through cloning and modification, ensuring the right fit for every situation.

## View forms in Rewst

Access all forms, be they manually created by you or obtained as part of unpacking Crates, by navigating to **Automations > Forms** in the left side menu.

### Export and import forms

You can export a form to share with other Rewst customers, or create your own hard copies of form backups. To export a form as a JSON bundle, **click ⋮ > Export** next to your relevant form in the total form list.

To import a form bundled as a JSON file, click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-10-21 at 4.48.45 PM.png>) in the top right navigation bar of the forms page. Then, drag and drop your file into the upload dialog that appears.
