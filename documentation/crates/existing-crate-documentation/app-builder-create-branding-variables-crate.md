## What does the App Builder - Create Branding Variables Crate do?

Our App Builder - Create Branding Variables Crate contains a form that enables users to update the style variables for any prebuilt app, such as the [Forms Portal, End User Portal, or Reporting Portal](../../app-builder/prebuilt-apps/). It retrieves the current branding settings for the selected app and theme of dark or light, and displays them to the user. Users can then input new hex codes for their colors and upload logos if necessary. Upon submission, the Crate updates the relevant style templates and applies the new branding site-wide for the selected app.

* The crate doesn't perform CSS modifications outside of predefined variables, such as specific layout changes or custom font adjustments.
* It doesn't apply changes automatically without user input. Manual form submission is required to update branding.
* It doesn't support highly complex custom CSS overrides, as this crate focuses on simplifying the branding process.

This Crate also supports configuration at both the MSP and customer levels, allowing different branding for different user groups depending on who logs into the portal.
