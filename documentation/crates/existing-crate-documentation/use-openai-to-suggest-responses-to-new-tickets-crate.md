## What does the Use OpenAI to Suggest Responses to New Tickets Crate do?

The workflow in this Crate automatically adds AI-generated troubleshooting advice as an internal note to new PSA tickets that contain only the initial problem description. This gives IT technicians immediate guidance on how to approach and resolve the reported issue, while ensuring the advice is security-focused and appropriate for technical staff rather than end users.

The workflow only acts on tickets with a single note to avoid interfering with tickets that already have ongoing conversations or resolutions.

### How the Crate works

1. The workflow starts and identifies which PSA system sent the trigger by checking the organization's default PSA setting.
2. It waits briefly to see if other automations will handle the ticket first, avoiding duplicate responses.
3. Based on the PSA type, it fetches ticket notes:
   * **ConnectWise PSA**: Lists service ticket notes
   * **Datto PSA**: Lists notes on ticket&#x20;
   * **Halo PSA**: Lists ticket actions and notes
   * **Kaseya BMS**: Uses ticket details directly
4. It then verifies that the ticket has exactly one note. If there are no notes or multiple notes, the workflow ends without action
5. If there's a single note, it sends the ticket content to OpenAI with:
   * System prompt, positioning AI as a helpful IT helpdesk mentor
   * The ticket note as the problem to solve
   * Instructions to provide advice to technicians and not end users
6. OpenAI generates a helpful response with markdown formatting, focusing on security-conscious advice.
7. The AI-generated response is added as an internal note to the original ticket.

### Crate prerequisites
