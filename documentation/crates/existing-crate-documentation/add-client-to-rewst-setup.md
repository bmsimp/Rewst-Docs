## Use the Crate

1. Navigate to **Automations > Forms** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. Search for `Add New Client to Rewst`.
3. Click **⋮> Usages > View Direct URLs.**
4. Click on the link for the organization which contains the user you wish to manage. This will launch the form in a new tab.
5. Fill out the form as follows:

### What you need to fill out the form

Once you're in the form, you'll see the following fields:

* **Company Name**: The name of the company you want to add to Rewst
* **Customer Primary Domain**: The domain of the company - for example, `Rewstyhouse.com .`

This form will also give you the option to map the following installed integration categories:

* **PSA**
* **RMM**
* **Network Monitoring & Remote Admin**
* **Documentation & CRM**
* **Licensing & Distribution**
* **Backup & Security**

With the above filled out and configured, you can add or invite users to the new site as the following roles:

* **Forms-only User**: Only able to view Rewst forms
* **Member Users**: Able to view forms, results, and create workflows in Rewst

**Organization Variables Needed**

Setting the following variables will allow a number of Crates, including the New User Onboarding Crate, to work without further client-specific setup:

* **Primary Identity Provider**: Azure Active Directory, On-prem AD, JumpCloud
* **New User Approval Email**: used if there needs to be an approver for new user creation
* **User Name Format**: Username Format for user creation Flast, First.Last etc
* **User Start-Date Behavior**: Document the start date in the ticket and create the user now, or pause workflow until the set user creation date
* **Do not attempt to create a new o365 mailbox**: check this box if you do not want a mailbox created for the user
{% endhint %}

When all fields and desired settings have been updated, remember to click **Submit**.

**Make sure you map the Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) tenant for your customer**

You will then want to find the CSP tenant for your new customer and map it to the Rewst organization that you have created. You can do this by navigating to **Configuration > Integrations > Microsoft Cloud** to find the relevant CSP tenant.
