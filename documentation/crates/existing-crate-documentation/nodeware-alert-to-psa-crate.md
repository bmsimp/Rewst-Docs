# Nodeware: Alert To PSA Crate

## What does the Nodeware: Alert to PSA Crate Do?

This Crate creates a ticket when a new critical vulnerability is detected by Nodeware. It runs daily and creates tickets for new vulnerability alerts, checking existing tickets to see if the CVE still exists. If resolved, it closes the ticket. If still present, it updates the ticket and leaves it open.

Contents of the ticket include:

* Vulnerability
* UUID
* Severity
* Timestamp
* URL to the CVE within Nodeware
