## What does the Update Ticket With Form Link - Generic Crate do?

This Crate will allow you to provide a variable configuration— via trigger variable—  or input configuration— via workflow input— at runtime, with the name of a form you would like to use to update single or multiple tickets.

## How the Crate works

* This Crate uses PSA ticket triggers to receive ticket updates and update the ticket with a note containing a link to the specific form.
* This Crate uses trigger criteria to determine what ticket updates to take actions on.

## Crate prerequisites

Before unpacking this Crate, you'll need to have your PSA successfully integrated with Rewst. This Crate works with the following PSAs:

* [Connectwise PSA](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/connectwise-integration-setup.md)
* [Datto Autotask PSA](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/datto-psa-integration-setup/)
* [Halo PSA](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/halo-integration-setup.md)
* [Kaseya BMS](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/kaseya-bms-integration-setup.md)
* [Freshdesk](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/freshdesk-integration-setup.md)

## Unpack the Update Ticket With Form Link - Generic Crate

1. Navigate to **Crates > Crate Marketplace** in the left side menu of the Rewst Platform.
2.  Search for `Update Ticket With Form Link - Generic`.\

3. Click on the Crate tile to begin the unpacking process.
4. Click **Unpack Crate**.
5. Click **Continue.**
6. Notice that there are multiple accordion menus, each pertaining to a separate brand of PSA. By default, each PSA's triggers will be defaulted to off. Click to expand your relevant PSA's accordion menu.
7. Toggle **Enabled** to on. If desired, add any [trigger criteria](../../automations/intro-to-triggers/trigger-criteria.md) or integration overrides.
8. Click **Unpack.**

Now, you'll need to go to the workflow unpacked with the Crate and set up your trigger variables.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you do not have a trigger variable configured before running the workflow in the Crate, the workflow will not run. Trigger variable configuration is a necessary part of this workflow's success.
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. Search for `[REWST - PROCESS] PSA: Update Ticket With Form Link - Generic`.&#x20;
3. Click on the workflow to open it in the Workflow Builder Canvas.
4. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (8).png>) to edit your trigger.

Under “Trigger Variables,” there is a required “Form Name” field set to “[REWST – EXAMPLE] Rewst: Example Form,” with a note stating it is an overrideable field. The interface has a dark background with white text and gray input boxes."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
6. Recommended: Add trigger criteria that limits what tickets the workflow will run for when the trigger kicks off based on criteria you define. This could be criteria such as board, queue, type, subtype, item, etc.
7. Click **Submit**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you would like to use this Crate for several forms, you'll need to create a separate trigger instance for each form.
