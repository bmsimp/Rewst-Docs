### What does the OpenAI Ticket Sentiment Analysis Crate do?

The OpenAI Ticket Sentiment Analysis Crate streamlines support operations by using AI to assess and act on ticket sentiment, impact, urgency, and priority. As new tickets are created, it retrieves ticket details, analyzes severity, and updates relevant PSA fields automatically. High-sentiment tickets are escalated and assigned to designated team members, while a detailed internal note logs the results. Fully integrated with your PSA, this Crate ensures faster, smarter ticket handling.

### Crate prerequisites

* Before unpacking the Crate, you'll need to have the integration for one of the following PSAs set up:
  * [ConnectWise PSA](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/connectwise-integration-setup.md)
  * [Datto PSA](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/datto-psa-integration-setup/)
  * [HaloPSA](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/halo-integration-setup.md)
  * [Kaseya BMS](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/kaseya-bms-integration-setup.md)

&#x20;      If you're using a PSA that isn't on this list, please let us know and we'll look at whether it has the    ability to trigger an automation based on a ticket being created.

* You'll also need to have the OpenAI integration set up in Rewst.

### Set up the OpenAI Ticket Sentiment Crate

5. Choose your desired PSA from the drop-down selector. This is especially important for customers using multiple PSAs.&#x20;
6. Choose your detection category from the drop-down selector.
7. Choose the AI model that you wish to use from the drop-down selector. OpenAI returns all of the data in a JSON object, including an integer for Sentiment, Urgency, and Impact. We then use the options you specify below to determine whether the ticket should be updated or not.
   1.  **Impact Threshold:**

       This is the threshold that you want to set for the impact of the ticket. If the impact is below this threshold, the ticket will be considered low impact. If the impact is above this threshold, the ticket will be considered high impact, and update the ticket accordingly.
   2.  **Urgency Threshold:**

       This is the threshold that you want to set for the urgency of the ticket. If the urgency is below this threshold, the ticket will be considered low urgency. If the urgency is above this threshold, the ticket will be considered high urgency, and update the ticket accordingly.
   3.  **Sentiment Threshold:**

       This is the threshold that you want to set for the sentiment of the ticket. If the sentiment is below this threshold, the ticket will be considered a positive sentiment. If the sentiment is above this threshold, the ticket will be considered negative sentiment, and update the ticket accordingly.
8. Choose if you would like to **Report errors in ticket when unable to utilize AI**.
9. Click **Continue**.
10. Triggers for all possible PSAs are included in this Crate. By default, they're disabled, and only the PSA indicated by your choice in the drop-down selector used in the previous step will be enabled. The trigger that will kick off the automation when a ticket is created is the one left enabled.&#x20;
11. Click **Unpack**.
