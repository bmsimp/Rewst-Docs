## What does the Thread Automations Crate do?

Our Thread Automations Crate establishes a flexible integration framework between Thread and Rewst, enabling various automated processes through webhook integration. Currently, the crate focuses on onboarding automation, capturing user information submitted through Thread Intents and passing it to Rewst workflows for further processing.

* Uses the dedicated intent in Thread that collects essential information for different automation scenarios
* Currently uses the default Rewst onboarding automation that collects First Name, Last Name, Username, and Email Address
* Securely transmits collected data to Rewst via webhooks when an Intent is completed
* Enables automatic processing of tasks in Rewst based on the submitted information
* Provides confirmation feedback to users about their submitted information directly in the PSA ticket
* Maintains security through secret key validation between Thread and Rewst

This Crate doesn’t perform validation on the data beyond what Thread provides natively. Any complex validation logic or business rules would need to be implemented in the Rewst workflow that receives the webhook data.

### Why use the Thread Automation Crate?

* **Continuous monitoring**: Automatically detect and processes new requests as they come in through Thread, via webhook
* **Seamless integration**: Connect Thread's user-friendly interface with Rewst's powerful automation capabilities
* **Efficiency**: Eliminate manual data entry and reduce process time by automating information flow
* **Security**: Implement webhook secrets to ensure secure transmission of sensitive data

## Unpack the Thread Automations Crate

### Set up steps in Thread

Note that the individual setting up the integration must be an admin in Thread.

1. Log into your Thread account.
2. Navigate to [**Thread Admin**](https://admin.getthread.com/) **> Magic AI > Magic Agents > Catalog**.
3. Click **Create Intent**.
4. Enter the intent details into their relevant fields exactly as follows:
   * **Intent Name**: `Rewst - Onboarding` \
     ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-09 at 1.33.24 PM.png>)
   *   **Describe the intent**: `An intent to assist in building new intents within the Magic Agent service catalog by gathering necessary information, including crafting effective prompts for arguments. Think logically about the user’s intent and craft questions to fill in more about the issue or request, like features IT might need. The goal is to ask the right questions to gather accurate information so a Tier 2 IT Service Tech will have all they need to resolve the issue. Keep questions succinct, minimal, logically ordered, and ensure logical consistency.` \

   * **Visibility filters**: Choose the **Specific clients** option to select your internal or test companies, or modify to specific client types as needed. If you would rather, choose **All clients**.&#x20;
5.  Click **+Add form field** three times to create a total of four form fields, including the one that was available when you first created the intent. Name them each as follows:

    1. `First Name`
    2. `Last Name`
    3. `Username`
    4. `Email Address`&#x20;

    Note that adding additional fields beyond what is indicated here will require you to configure the Thread wrapper to pass into the Rewst workflow.

## Use the Crate

#### **Intent fields**

You can modify the fields collected in the Thread Intent to match your specific requirements. The default onboarding setup includes First Name, Last Name, Username, and Email Address.
