## What does the Microsoft: User Offboarding Crate do?

Our Microsoft: User Offboarding Crate streamlines the offboarding process for users within an organization, for time savings and increased efficiency. The automation is triggered via a form submission, allowing designated personnel to initiate the offboarding tasks.

* **Detailed ticketing**: Automation logging steps that are done throughout the offboarding process are documented by logging entries to the ticket, via a single note, making it easier to tell where an issue occurred and what steps were performed.
* **Efficiency**: Streamline the user offboarding process by increasing time savings and decreasing the potential for user error.
* **Security**: Ensure that necessary offboarding steps are performed when an account is terminated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This Crate does not handle On-Prem Exchange and will only handle Exchange functionality via Office 365.

* Detailed Ticketing

## Org variables in use for the Microsoft: User Offboarding Crate

{% hint style="info" %}
For information specific to these org variables please review our guidance organization variables [here](../../configuration/organization-variables.md).&#x20;

Note that org variables not found in the organization variables documentation are typically system variables that are handled by the integration mappings.

If you haven't done so already, it's recommended that you run the [org variable configuration crate](https://app.rewst.io/marketplace/crates/eb2e46d9-56b1-4561-b9e6-c281a1275c67), which will help you set org variables that are relevant to you and your customer's environments.

## Recommended migration path

{% hint style="warning" %}
☝️If you’re using a previous version of the onboarding workflow, follow these migration steps below. If this is your first time using this Crate, this information isn't relevant to you.
{% endhint %}

1. Unpack this Crate in your environment.
2. Perform testing to make sure that you have all the required organization variables set correctly. The same variables are used in this updated Crate as were used in the previous version. If you need to update any organization variables, then please follow [this guide](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/existing-crate-documentation/configure-organization-variables).
3. After testing and confirming that it is functioning as expected, please move forward with the steps below:
   1. If you plan to utilize the updated form in this crate, rather than the legacy form:
      1. Go to the [previous crate's](https://app.rewst.io/marketplace/crates/018fdeb1-347e-7de5-93d9-61f6ce9fba31) top level workflow and disable any form triggers. This will prevent users from submitting requests to the wrong workflow.
      2. Update your internal documentation with the new form links.
      3. If Applicable, provide your customers with their new form link.
   2. You are able to link the previous Crates form to this version, though given the minimal differences there may not be a clear advantage other than not needing to change the link destinations. The previous form will not receive any further updates or enhancements.
