## What does the Identify Users in Bypass Mode Crate do?

The Crate’s workflow has a weekly cron trigger. Guarantee that any user in bypass mode is regularly identified, and not missed or forgotten.

### Why use the Identify Users in Bypass Mode Crate?

* Identify users in bypass mode
* Provide an auditable trail for documentation and remediation
