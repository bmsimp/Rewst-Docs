## What does the Time Savings Report Crate do?

Boost your team's efficiency with our Time Savings Report Crate, designed to turn your workflow data into actionable insights with zero manual effort. This automation gathers execution data across your workflows, calculates total time saved, and transforms it into a clear, comprehensive report. Delivered straight to your inbox and accessible online anytime, the report empowers you to track productivity gains at a glance. With built-in filtering by workflow status and sub-organization, plus reusable templates stored in Rewst for consistency, you’ll have everything you need to demonstrate impact and make informed decisions—automatically.

## Test the Crate

This Crate will send the email at a set date and time based off of the preferences you set during the unpacking process. To force the Crate to trigger sooner, update your configuration page for the Crate to send the report every 5 minutes. Once you've confirmed that it works, update the configuration again to your desired timeline.&#x20;
