## What does the Google: User Onboarding Crate do?

The Google Workspace User Onboarding Crate automates and streamlines the process of onboarding new users into a Google Workspace environment. Enhance efficiency, accuracy, and consistency, ensuring all key tasks for new user creation are completed seamlessly.

This Crate does not support synchronization from on-premises Active Directory to Google Workspace. Licenses are applied based on the organizational unit selected from the form, without advanced custom rules. Any manual corrections or input errors must be handled outside of the workflow.

### How the Crate works

The workflow is triggered when the onboarding form unpacked from the Crate is submitted with all required details. Automatically create a new user account in Google Workspace using details provided via the form, and complete an array of standard onboarding actions for that user, all from one convenient location.

## Crate prerequisites

Our [Google Workspace Admin integration](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/google-admin/google-workspace-admin-sdk-integration-setup.md) must first be successfully set up before unpacking this Crate.

Your [PSA ](../../configuration/integrations/top-5-integration-types-get-started-with-integrations-in-rewst.md#psa-integrations)must be successfully integrated with Rewst.

You must first add the [organization variables](../../configuration/organization-variables.md#what-is-an-organization-variable) `primary_identity_provider` and `default_PSA` in Rewst.&#x20;
