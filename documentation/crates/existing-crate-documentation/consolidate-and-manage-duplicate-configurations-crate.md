## What does the Consolidate and Manage Duplicate Configurations Crate do?

This Crate identifies duplicate configurations in ConnectWise PSA and ensures that only the latest version, based on last updated device information, is retained. It can also remediate the data if needed.

### How the Crate works

* The workflow **s**earches through all configurations in ConnectWise PSA for duplicates.
* It uses the last updated device information to identify the most recent configuration.
* It keeps the latest configuration and deletes the duplicates.
* Optionally, use the last updated device information to correct any discrepancies in the configuration.

## Crate prerequisites
