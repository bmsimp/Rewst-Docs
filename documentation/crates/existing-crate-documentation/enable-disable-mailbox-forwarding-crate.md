## What does the Enable / Disable Mailbox Forwarding Crate do?

This Crate allows for straightforward enablement or disablement of mailbox forwarding while maintaining a comprehensive audit log in your PSA.

### How the Crate works

1. Users or techs fill out a simple form to enable or disable mailbox forwarding.
2. The action is executed according to the user's input.
3. A log of the action taken is appended to the associated ticket in your PSA, providing a full audit trail.

### Crate prerequisites

* Your [PSA must be successfully integrated](../../configuration/integrations/top-5-integration-types-get-started-with-integrations-in-rewst.md#psa-integrations) with Rewst before unpacking this Crate.&#x20;
* The [Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle/) must be set up before unpacking this Crate.
