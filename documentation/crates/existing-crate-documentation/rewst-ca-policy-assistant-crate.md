## What does the REWST CA Policy Assistant Crate do?

This Crate contains a form that retrieves parent tenant sign-in error logs from the last 14 days and emails a list of all enabled Conditional Access policies, with a link to each for easy navigation to the policy in Microsoft Entra. Policies are omitted if the selected user is excluded in the parent tenant, while child-tenant policies that exclude the tenant externally are still shown and highlighted. If no integration email is provided, all enabled policies are listed. Administrators can choose which actions to perform for specific organizations and users, and which reports to generate, including:

* Forcing password changes
* Invalidating user sessions
* Blocking sign-ins
* Generating various reports - sign-in activity, mailflow, MFA methods, etc.

This Crate does not list disabled Conditional Access policies, show parent-tenant policies where the selected user is excluded, or retrieve sign-in logs older than two weeks. It doesn't modify, enable or disable, or create Conditional Access policies—this Crate is for retrieval, listing, and highlighting only. It does, however, provide a link to each CA Policy in Entra.&#x20;

## Crate prerequisites

There are two ways to use this Crate: with the [Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle/), and without the Bundle.&#x20;

With the Bundle, you'll select the proper option on the form, and Rewst will take care of the rest.

Without the Bundle, you'll need to follow additional steps given in the form to set up app registration with the specific needed permissions.
