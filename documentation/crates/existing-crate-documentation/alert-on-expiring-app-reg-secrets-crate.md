## What does the Alert on Expiring App Reg Secrets Crate do?

## Test the Crate

To test this Crate, you'll need to adjust the cron trigger's schedule to a few minutes in the future, then adjust it back to your regular schedule after the test. Alternatively, you could wait until the regularly scheduled run occurs and check your result, which would not require you to update the cron trigger schedule.

1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows**.
2.  Search for `Alert on Expiring App Client Secrets [Part 1]`.
