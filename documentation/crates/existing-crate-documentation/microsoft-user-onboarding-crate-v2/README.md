## **What does the Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate do?**

The Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate automates the user onboarding process by streamlining account creation, group assignments, licensing, and additional configurations across Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD, and on-premises Active Directory.

Ensure that new employees or contractors are provisioned accurately and consistently based on predefined policies, integrating seamlessly with PSA, RMM, documentation, and licensing systems.

## How the Crate works

Once the form unpacked from the Crate is submitted, the Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate executes the following steps:

#### **1. Form submission and validation**

* The process starts when a user submits the \[Crate] Microsoft: User Onboarding form.
* The workflow checks if the user already exists in AD or Azure AD.
* The form captures necessary user details, including personal information, group memberships, licensing, and security settings.
* PSA integration retrieves the user's location, if available.
* If the New User Approval System is enabled, an approval request is sent before proceeding.
* All required fields are validated before proceeding.

#### **2. Ticket creation and management**

* If no ticket exists, a new one is created.
* If a ticket already exists, it is updated with onboarding progress.

#### **3. User account creation**

* The user account is created based on the selected identity provider:
  * On-Prem AD Only: A new AD account is created.
  * Azure AD Only: A new Entra ID (Azure AD) account is created.
  * Hybrid with Sync: A new AD account is created and synced to Azure AD.
  * Hybrid with No Sync: Separate accounts are created in both directories.

#### **4. Group and license assignments**

* Security groups are assigned in AD or Azure AD.
* Microsoft 365 licenses are applied via direct assignment or group membership.
* Shared mailbox permissions are configured if applicable.

#### **5. Credential and notification handling**

* A secure temporary password is generated.
* The password is securely stored in PSA, ITGlue, Hudu, or sent via email or SMS.
* The user’s manager may optionally be notified of credential details.

#### **6. Ticket update and completion**

* Final provisioning details are logged in the PSA ticket.
* The onboarding process is marked complete, and workflow logs are stored.

## Crate prerequisites

Before unpacking the Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate, make sure that the following requirements are met.

### Required integrations

* The [Microsoft Cloud integration bundle](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/cloud/-cloud-integration-bundle) must be set up first. This enables Microsoft Graph API access for Azure AD and M365 provisioning.
* &#x20;For Active Directory setup, you’ll need to first set up your [RMM integration](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/rmm), or [Agent Smith](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/agent-smith). This is optional.
* [PSA Integration](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/psa) must be setup. This is required for automated ticket creation and ticket updates. This is optional.
* [Documentation Integrations](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/documentation) must be set up if you wish to create documentation in your knowledge base. This is optional.
* [Licensing integrations](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/licensing) should be completed if you wish to set up automated license purchases. Configure Pax8, Ingram Micro, Sherweb, or Synnex. This is optional.

### Overview of required context variables and organizational variables

The Microsoft: User Onboarding Crate uses context variables (CTX) and organizational variables to control user provisioning, security settings, licensing, and ticketing workflows.

* CTX variables store dynamic, user-specific data that persists throughout the onboarding process.
* Org variables define global settings for how Rewst interacts with Active Directory, Azure AD, PSA, RMM, and other integrations.

These variables must be correctly configured in Rewst before deploying the Crate. To update organizational variables, follow [this guide](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/existing-crate-documentation/configure-organization-variables).

<details>

<summary>Issue: User not created in Azure AD</summary>



#### **Symptoms:**

* No user is found in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
* The workflow fails before provisioning the account.

#### Possible causes:

* The identity provider configuration is incorrect.
* The workflow execution failed before user creation.
* The user already exists in Azure AD.

#### Solution:

1. Check the workflow execution logs in Automations > Results for errors.
2. Search manually for the user in Azure AD to confirm if the account exists.
3. Confirm your Microsoft GDAP configuration
   1. Proper GDAP setup is crucial for automation at the MSP level, eliminating the need for separate Microsoft integrations for each customer.
   2. Refer to the [GDAP Documentation](https://www.notion.so/Draft-Microsoft-User-Onboarding-Crate-V2-1a0b56f9907180c6af66fc86a836eb5e?pvs=21) for setup guidelines and best practices.
   3. Ensure that the necessary permissions and access levels are correctly assigned to prevent provisioning failures.
4. Verify Organizational Variables:
   * `primary_identity_provider = Azure AD / Hybrid`
   * `preferred_adconnect_server` is set (for hybrid sync).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Issue: User not created in Active Directory</summary>



#### **Symptoms:**

* No user appears in Active Directory Users & Computers (ADUC).
* The workflow fails before provisioning the account.

#### **Possible causes:**

* The RMM tool has not been configured.
* The identity provider configuration is incorrect.
* The workflow execution failed before user creation.
* The user already exists in Active Directory.

#### **Solution:**

1. Check the [integration guide](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/rmm) for the following RMMs and ensure you have completed the process:
   * Datto RMM
   * NinjaOne
   * Immybot
   * Kaseya VSA
   * Kaseya VSA X
   * N-able N-central
   * Agent Smith - Check the Documentation for [Agent Smith](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/agent-smith)
2. Verify the workflow execution logs in **Automations > Results** for errors.
3. Search manually for the user in ADUC to confirm if the account exists.
4. Verify Organizational Variables:
   * `primary_identity_provider = On-Prem AD / Hybrid`
   * `preferred_adconnect_server` is set (for hybrid sync).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Issue: Microsoft 365 license not assigned</summary>

#### **Symptoms:**

* The user is created in Azure AD but has no assigned license.
* The license purchase request fails in Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

#### Possible causes:

* No available licenses in the tenant.
* The user was not added to the correct license group.
* License auto-purchasing is disabled.

#### **Solution:**

1. Check available licenses in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
2. Enable automatic license purchasing in Rewst:
   * Set `auto_purchase_license_if_none_available = 1`.
3. Confirm license assignment method:
   * `m365_license_assignment_method = direct` for direct assignment.
   * `m365_license_assignment_method = group` for group-based assignment.

If using group-based licensing, ensure the user is added to the correct M365 License Group. If using the Manual Process, Check the Manual License Purchase Process

</details>

<details>

<summary>Issue: User not added to security groups</summary>



#### **Symptoms:**

* The user appears in AD/Azure AD but is not assigned to any security groups.
* Permissions are missing due to lack of group membership.

#### Possible causes:

* The group selection was missed during onboarding.
* The group name is incorrect or does not exist in AD/Azure AD.

#### Solution:

1. Check the selected groups in the onboarding form submission.
2. Manually search for the group in Active Directory Users & Computers or Azure AD.
3. Ensure group synchronization is active (for hybrid configurations).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Issue: PSA ticket not created or updated</summary>



#### **Symptoms:**

* No onboarding ticket appears in ConnectWise, Autotask, or other PSA.
* The ticket is created but missing onboarding details.

#### Possible causes:

* PSA integration is not configured correctly.
* PSA API credentials are incorrect or expired.
* The company contact does not exist in PSA.

#### **Solution:**

1. Verify PSA integration settings in Rewst.
2. Check the workflow execution logs for API errors.
3. Manually create a test ticket in PSA to confirm integration functionality.
4. Confirm the `default_psa` is not set to be `mail_only`

</details>

<details>

<summary>Issue: Required fields in Halo preventing ticket creation or updates</summary>



#### Symptoms:

* Ticket creation or updates in Halo PSA fail unexpectedly.
* Errors appear related to missing mandatory fields when attempting to create or update a ticket.
* The default Halo PSA ruleset causes validation failures.

#### Possible causes:

* Mandatory fields are enabled in Halo PSA, preventing Rewst from creating or updating tickets.
* The default Halo PSA ruleset requires additional fields not configured in the workflow.
* The \[REWST - TASK] PSA-Halo PSA: Create Ticket action does not include the required mandatory field values.

#### **S**olution:

1. Remove mandatory fields from your PSA to allow for seamless automation.
2. Unsync your PSA-Halo Create Ticket Crate to manually modify field requirements:
   * Navigate to \[REWST - TASK] PSA-Halo PSA: Create Ticket.
   * In the halo\_create\_ticket action, ensure all mandatory fields have valid values.
3. Understand the impact of unsyncing a Crate:
   * By default, all Crates are synced when unpacked.
   * Unsyncing a Crate allows customization but requires manual maintenance.
   * We recommend using synced Crates until you’ve completed Rewst training in Cluck University.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Issue: Password not stored in documentation system</summary>



#### **Symptoms:**

* The password does not appear in ITGlue, Hudu, or Passportal.
* The PSA ticket is missing the temporary password.

#### **Possible causes:**

* Documentation integration is not enabled.
* API credentials for ITGlue/Hudu/Passportal are incorrect or expired.

#### **Solution:**

1. Enable password storage by setting `store_user_credentials_in_external_doc = 1`.
2. Check the API integration settings in Rewst.
3. Test manual credential storage to confirm integration is working.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Issue: Delayed user creation not working</summary>



#### Symptoms:

* The user is created immediately, despite a future start date.
* The workflow does not pause as expected.

#### Possible causes:

* The Start Date field was missing or not populated.
* The `allow_scheduled_user_creation` setting is disabled.
* The workflow scheduler is not running correctly.

#### Solution:

1. Ensure that the **Start Date** field is enabled in the onboarding form.
2. Set `allow_scheduled_user_creation = 1` in organizational variables.
3. Check scheduled automations in Rewst to verify execution timing.
