# PSA: Update Ticket With User Onboard Links Crate

{% hint style="info" %}
If youâ€™re new to Crates, read through our introductory Crate documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/crates).&#x20;

This Crate is our newest version of an older Crate which was called Add Rewst Form Link to New User Request Tickets. That Crate is now [deprecated](../../../prebuilt-automations/crates/crate-deprecation-faq.md). New Rewst users should only unpack this version of the Crate. Previous Rewst users are recommended to remove the older version of the Crate and unpack this Crate.
{% endhint %}

## What does the PSA: Update Ticket With User Onboard Links Crate do?

This Crate automatically filters and detects tickets, created or updated in your PSA, that match the set [trigger criteria](../../automations/intro-to-triggers/trigger-criteria.md). It then inserts a ticket note for the User Onboard Form directly into the ticket, for one clean place to enter everything IT needs.

### Why use the PSA: Update Ticket With User Onboard Links Crate?

Ensure that everyone fills out the same form, the same way, every time. Techs get all the info they need in the same format, speeding up user provisioning.

### How the Crate works

This workflow is initiated when a ticket that matches the set trigger criteria is created or updated.

* Collects ticket data from triggers when a ticket is created or updated
* Retrieves the trigger ID for the onboarding form
* Creates the text for the ticket note using a script
* Identifies if the ticket already has the generated ticket note
* If a note does not exist in the ticket, the note is added to the ticket
