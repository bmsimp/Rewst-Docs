## What does the Add Devices to Autopilot via Form Crate do?

Our Add Devices to Autopilot via Form Crate simplifies the process of adding devices to Autopilot with an easy-to-use form. The Crate enables you to perform the following:

* Manually enter the details of devices to be added to Autopilot
* Use the downloadable CSV template to easily import multiple devices
* Intuitive design ensures easy navigation and data entry

### How the Crate works

* The user has the option to either manually enter device details or upload a CSV file.
* A downloadable CSV template is available within the form for easy bulk entry.
* Once the form is submitted, the devices are automatically added to Autopilot.

3. Click on the workflow to view it in the Workflow Builder.&#x20;
4. Click **Test** in the top right corner of the Workflow Builder Canvas.
5. The following fields will show:
   * `force_default` **-** This field is used in form configurations to control whether a form field should use a predefined default value from organization variables. When set to `true`, it tells the form to use the corresponding `form_default_*` organization variable as the default value for that field.
   * `byod_object_type` **-** This field is related to the [Bring Your Own Database](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/byod-for-dattormm.md) or BYOD integration feature. BYOD is used to improve performance when RMM APIs are slow by caching data in a local database.
6. Click **Test**.
7. Allow the workflow to run.
8. You'll see a green success message at the top of your screen if the execution is successful. You'll see a red failure message if the execution fails. Click **View Results** for a more detailed breakdown of each.
