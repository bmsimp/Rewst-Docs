## What does the Compromised User Response Crate do?

This Crate is designed to manage user accounts and generate detailed reports based on selected actions within an organization. It helps administrators enforce security policies, monitor user activities, and audit mailbox configurations efficiently.

* Administrators can select an organization, users, and a date range. They can then take actions such as forcing password changes, invalidating user sessions, and blocking sign-ins.
* The workflow generates various reports, including sign-in activity, mailflow, app registrations, and MFA methods. It also provides a comprehensive report that covers mailbox settings, usage, managed devices, and more.
* It handles actions to maintain and enforce security, such as removing external mail forwards or blocking user sign-ins.
* It executes actions and generates reports based on form inputs, with the ability to process multiple options simultaneously.
* The workflow produces detailed reports that are accessible to the administrator, offering insights into user activity, security configurations, and mailbox statistics. If reporting options are selected, the reports are attached as an HTML file to the created ticket.

This workflow does not cover tasks outside of the selected options. Manual intervention is required for actions not included in the selectable list, such as custom security configurations or one-off user actions.

### How the Crate works

This Crate is kicked off by a form submission. Administrators can choose which actions to perform for specific organizations and users, and which reports to generate, including:

* Forcing password changes
* Invalidating user sessions
* Blocking sign-ins
* Generating various reports (sign-in activity, mailflow, MFA methods, etc.)
