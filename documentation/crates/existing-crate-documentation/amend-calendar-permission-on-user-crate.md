# Amend Calendar Permission on User Crate

## What does the Amend Calendar Permission on User Crate do?

This Crate simplifies managing calendar access in Microsoft 365 by allowing IT staff to quickly assign or remove calendar permissions for users. It ensures accurate access control by validating user identities, displaying current permissions, and applying role-based access such as Reviewer or Editor— ideal for onboarding, offboarding, and day-to-day support tasks.

### How the Crate works

* Identifies the organization within Rewst.
* Optionally uses a existing ticket, or otherwise creates a new one
* Specifies whose calendar permissions will be updated.
* Displays the user's current calendar permission entries.
* Adds or removes permissions:
  * Add: Grants access
  * Remove: Revokes access
* Chooses the users who will gain or lose access, and allows you to select the desired access level
* Defines the calendar permission level&#x20;
* Includes additional delegation settings if needed

{% hint style="warning" %}
This Crate requires valid users and permissions to be loaded before applying changes. It only applies to calendar permissions, not mailbox delegation.
