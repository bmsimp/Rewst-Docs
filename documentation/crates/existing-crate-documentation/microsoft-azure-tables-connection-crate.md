## What does the Microsoft Azure Tables Connection Crate do?

Along with a form to assist in the creation of the Azure tables instances, this Crate provides a subworkflow that can be used as a workflow action to interact with the data in tables, allowing full capabilities of Azure tables as a data storage mechanism within Rewst workflows.

## Crate prerequisites

The [Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle/) must be set up before unpacking this Crate.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Using the form in this Crate will provision a Microsoft Azure Table storage account. Learn about the costs [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/tables/) before proceeding.
