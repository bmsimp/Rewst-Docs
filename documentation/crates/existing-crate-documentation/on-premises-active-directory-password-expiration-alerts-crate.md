## What does the On-Premises Active Directory Password Expiration Alerts Crate do?

Our On-Premises Active Directory Password Expiration Alerts Crate automates the process of monitoring password expiration for on-premises Active Directory users, ensuring that users are notified well in advance. By sending timely email alerts, it helps maintain security and minimizes disruptions by prompting users to update their passwords before they expire.

This workflow is designed for on-premises Active Directory only. It does not monitor or interact with cloud-based directories like Entra ID. This Crate doesn't perform password resets; it only sends notifications. Users must update their passwords manually through the appropriate channels. The workflow does not provide real-time alerts. There may be a slight delay between when a password expiration is detected and when the notification is sent.

#### How the Crate works <a href="#how-the-crate-works" id="how-the-crate-works"></a>

* Automatically checks for user passwords expiring in 14, 7, 3, and 1 day, ensuring users are well-informed ahead of time
* Sends email alerts to users, reminding them to change their passwords before the expiration date, reducing the risk of account lockout
* Ensures that passwords are updated promptly, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access due to expired passwords
* Streamlines the password management process, lowering the frequency of IT support tickets related to password issues and freeing up resources for other critical tasks

The workflow is initiated by a scheduled task that runs a PowerShell script at predefined intervals.&#x20;

If Rewst's [PowerShell interpreter](../../rewst-tools/powershell-interpreter.md) tool is installed, Crate workflows which have multiple-system dependencies will have increased efficiency with faster and more consistent cloud-native executions that are completed in seconds.
