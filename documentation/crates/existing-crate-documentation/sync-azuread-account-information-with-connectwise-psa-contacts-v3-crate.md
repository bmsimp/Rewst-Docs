## What does the Sync AzureAD Account Information with ConnectWise PSA Contacts (V3) Crate do?

Our Sync AzureAD Account Information with ConnectWise PSA Contacts (V3) Crate synchronizes the M365 Account status with ConnectWise PSA and runs on a cron or recurring schedule.

### How the Crate works

The Crate checks Azure Active Directory daily for user accounts without matching ConnectWise PSA contacts and helps maintain synchronization between the two systems.

* Ensures that user information from Azure AD is properly reflected in ConnectWise PSA contacts
* Finds discrepancies between the two systems where users exist in one but not the other
* Helps maintain accurate contact information across both platforms
* Performs these checks daily to catch new users or changes

The Crate uses a cron trigger that runs automatically on a daily schedule at a predetermined time. This automated daily execution ensures that the Azure AD and ConnectWise PSA contacts stay synchronized without requiring any manual intervention.

## Crate prerequisites

* [ConnectWise PSA Integration](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/connectwise-integration-setup.md): Must be properly configured and connected to Rewst.
* [Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle](../../configuration/integrations/integration-guides/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle/):  Required for Azure AD access and user information retrieval.
* Proper Permissions: Appropriate permissions in both Azure AD and ConnectWise PSA to read user/contact data.
