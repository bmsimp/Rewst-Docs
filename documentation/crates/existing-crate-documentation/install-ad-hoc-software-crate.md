## What does the Install Ad-Hoc Software Crate do?

This Crate allows you to pick a device and a piece of software and install it on said device. This will create or update a ticket in ImmyBot.

### Why use the Install Ad-Hoc Software Crate?

* Simplify the software installation process for both end-users and technicians.
* Ensure seamless integration with ImmyBot for ticket management.
* Automate mundane tasks, allowing your team to focus on more complex issues.

### How the Crate works

1. Initiate the process by selecting the ticket related to the software installation in the form unpacked from the Crate.
2. Choose the specific software to install and the device to perform the action on.
3. Commence the installation process.
4. The relevant ticket in ImmyBot is updated automatically once the installation is complete.
