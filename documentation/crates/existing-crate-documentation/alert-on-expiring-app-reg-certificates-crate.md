## What does the Alert on Expiring App Reg Certificates Crate do?

Our Alert on Expiring App Reg Certificates Crate identifies any expiring certificates in your Application Registrations and logs individual tickets for each client as well as a detailed overall summary ticket. Reduce disruptions by getting notified on expiring application registration certificates.

## Test the Crate

To test this Crate, you'll need to adjust the cron trigger's schedule to a few minutes in the future, then adjust it back to your regular schedule after the test. Alternatively, you could wait until the regularly scheduled run occurs and check your result, which would not require you to update the cron trigger schedule.

1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows**.
2.  Search for `Alert on Expiring App Certs [Part 1]`.\

3.  Click on the workflow to open it in the workflow builder.\
