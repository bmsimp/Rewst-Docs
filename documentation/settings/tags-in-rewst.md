# Tags

## What are tags in Rewst?

_Tags_ let you earmark the automations that you care about most, for quick searching and access. Tags can be added by users with the [permission levels](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/user-management/roles) of member, staff, and admin.

## Add tags to workflows

{% hint style="success" %}
The below directions will walk you through how to use tags for workflows, as an example. These same directions will work for how to add tags to forms, scripts, and templates, all found under Automations in the left side menu of Rewst. Once a tag is created, it can be applied to any automation type.
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to **Automations** > **Workflows** in Rewst.
2. Click the three dots to the right of your relevant workflow.
3.  Select **Edit Tags**.<br>

4. Open the **Tags** drop down in the **Edit Workflow Attributes** dialog to choose an existing tag from the list. Alternatively, begin typing in the drop down field and select the box to **Create tag**. This action will also add that new tag to your drop-down list for all future tag selections.
5. **Submit** when finished tagging. If successful, you’ll see a green **Workflow saved!** confirmation pop up at the top of your screen. Now, tags for that workflow will appear in the tag column of your workflows page.

## Tag workflows in bulk

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bulk editing workflow tags will overwrite all previous tags currently set for those selected workflows.
{% endhint %}

1. Check the checkbox to the left of each desired workflow in your workflows page.
2. Select the **Bulk Select Tags** icon that appears to the right of the **Search** field.\

3. Follow steps as usual to edit or create new tags for your selected workflows. Note that if your multiple selections will result in overriding existing tags, the dialog will display a warning message.\

4. Click **Submit** when finished tagging. If successful, you’ll see a green Workflow saved! confirmation pop up at the top of your screen. Now, tags for that workflow will appear in the tag column of your workflows page.

## Filter by tag

1. Open the **Tags** drop-down menu under the header of your workflows page. Check off one or more tags from the list.\
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5.22.19 PM.png>)
2. Your returned list will filter results to only display workflows tagged with your chosen tag.

## Color code tags

For quick visual reference of categories, tags can be color coded.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Tags** in the left side menu.
2. Here you can edit individual existing tags via the pencil icon, delete existing tags via the trashcan icon, or add new tags via the **+** sign to the top right of the **Manage Tags** screen.

## Use cases for tags

Say you want better visual indicators for your long list of automations, not just text. For example, you could choose to make all Powershell workflows red.

Tags can also be used to mark associations between pieces of a larger workflow. Consider a parent workflow which contains several child workflows and a form. Each piece of that parent workflow could be tagged with one tag. Then, you’d select that tag to isolate everything for just that one workflow, regardless of the pieces you used to create it.
