# App Builder: Pages

## What are App Builder pages?

Apps consist of _pages._ Pages are made up of _components_ like images, text, forms, tables, and charts. Every app's info page will contain a **Pages** section where all the default pages made by Rewst for that app will be listed. Each app you create will automatically have both a **home** and **login** page.  Both are customizable. Note that you can only have one home and one login page per app.
