## What are Prebuilt Apps?

Prebuilt Apps are your gateway to powerful, ready-made solutions that enhance your workflows and user experience. Think of them like App Builder's version of regular Rewst Crates: prepackaged applications meant to help you get started with App Builder, without having to build from scratch.\
Each app is designed to help you streamline operations, improve user satisfaction, and unlock valuable insights.&#x20;

As a bonus, you can customize your Prebuilt Apps by unpacking our [App Builder - Create Branding Variables](https://app.rewst.io/organizations/40f8b55a-e8a9-42fc-8dc1-179616275f10/marketplace/crates/0192bf3c-1cc2-7726-b33b-ecf5878e559b) Crate, which lets you update your apps without manual CSS edits for a professional, client-ready appearance.

* Apply consistent branding across all apps
* Input hex codes, upload logos, and select themes to apply at the MSP or client level
