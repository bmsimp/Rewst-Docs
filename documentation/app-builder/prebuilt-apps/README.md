### Add custom styles to Prebuilt Apps

Customizability has been a top priority in the development of the Prebuilt Apps. We wanted to make it effortless for users to apply their own branding, including colors and logos, without needing to manually adjust the app itself. To achieve this, we‚Äôve built everything using templates and **HTML Containers**, but we‚Äôve also simplified the process by creating an automation that lets you update these templates using hex codes‚Äîno need to learn CSS!

You can use our prebuilt form, which can be installed via a crate located [here](https://app.rewst.io/marketplace/crates/0192bf3c-1cc2-7726-b33b-ecf5878e559b). This form will guide you through updating the branding for any Prebuilt App. Simply select which app you want to update, choose between light or dark mode (yes, we‚Äôve included a theme toggle for all our sites!), and we‚Äôll display the current values set for the site. To update them, just input your desired hex codes, such as `#000000` for black.

The best part? This customization works at both the MSP level and the client level. Depending on who logs into the portal, they‚Äôll experience different branding‚Äîyour clients can see their own custom look while your techs enjoy your MSP‚Äôs branding.  Simply run the form for whomever you want to update, the same way you do for normal client triggers.
