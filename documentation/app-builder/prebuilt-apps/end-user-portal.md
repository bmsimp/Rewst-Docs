# App Builder Prebuilt Apps: End user portal

{% hint style="info" %}
End user portals, like all Prebuilt Apps, are available by request only. To request Prebuilt Apps, send us a message in your dedicated Discord support channel.
{% endhint %}

The _end user portal_ is built around self-service automation, letting you manage tasks independently while still maintaining the ability to log tickets for more complex needs. With 24/7 access to essential automations, this portal reduces reliance on service desk calls and streamlines operations for both you and your end users.
