# End User Portal

{% hint style="warning" %}
End User Portals, like all Prebuilt Apps, are currently available by request only. To request Prebuilt Apps, send us a message in your dedicated Discord support channel.
{% endhint %}

The **End User Portal** is built around self-service automation, letting you manage tasks independently while still maintaining the ability to log tickets for more complex needs. With 24/7 access to essential automations, this portal reduces reliance on service desk calls and streamlines operations for both you and your end users.
