# App Builder

{% hint style="info" %}
Rewst's earliest version of App Builder was called App Platform. App Builder is the same product as App Platform, now with a more descriptive name.&#x20;

App Builder works best for users who have some existing skills in HTML and CSS. For free tutorials on how to learn those skills, Rewst recommends [W3 Schools' tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [Mozilla's intro and guided practice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Tutorials).

## **What is App Builder?**&#x20;

App Builder is an extension of Rewst’s automation platform that allows MSPs to quickly build front-end web applications for interacting with Rewst-generated data from workflows, forms, and data. Apps consist of _pages_, and pages are made up of _components_ like images, text, forms, tables, and charts. Use App Builder to drive additional efficiency, consistency, and visibility gains, and differentiate your personal brand through engaging front-end experiences.

## Why use App Builder?

Design app screens or pages by dragging and dropping UI components such as text blocks, images, buttons, data tables, grid containers, forms, and workflow inputs. Theme your apps with your company's logo, color palette, and typography, and host them on custom subdomains to provide a fully white-labeled experience.
