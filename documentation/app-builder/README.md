Introducing App Builder
{% endembed %}

## **What is App Builder?**&#x20;

App Builder is an extension of Rewst’s automation platform that allows MSPs to quickly build web applications for interacting with Rewst-generated data from workflows, forms, and data. It drives additional efficiency, consistency, and visibility gains, and helps our MSPs differentiate themselves through engaging front-end experiences.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rewst's earliest version of App Builder was called App Platform. App Builder is the same product at App Platform, now with a more descriptive name.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Why use App Builder?

Design app screens or pages by dragging and dropping UI components such as text blocks, images, buttons, data tables, grid containers, forms, and workflow inputs. Theme your apps with your company's logo, color palette, and typography, and host them on custom subdomains to provide a fully white-labeled experience.
