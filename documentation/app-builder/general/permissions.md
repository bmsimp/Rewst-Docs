# Permissions

By default, users with Admin and Member roles have access to App Builder.&#x20;

#### App permissions

1. **Navigate to the App Page**: If you've created an app, find the app you want to manage in the Apps Table.
2. **Click the Three Dots**: Look for the three dots next to your app. Click on them for more options.
3. **Select "Permission"**: A modal will appear where you can manage who has access.
4. **Choose Roles and Organizations**: Pick the roles and organizations that should have access to your live app.
5. **Save Changes**: Don't forget to save your changes!

#### Page permissions

1. **Open an App to get to the Pages table**: Locate the specific page you want to manage in the Pages Table.
2. **Click the Three Dots**: Just like with apps, click on the three dots next to your page.
3. **Choose "Permission"**: This will open the permission settings for that particular page.
4. **Pick Roles and Organizations**: Select the roles and organizations that you want to grant access to for this page.
5. **Save Your Settings**: Make sure to save your changes so they take effect.

### What are roles and organizations?

#### Roles

_Roles_ are like groups that define what someone can do. For example, you might have a role for "Editors" who can modify content and another role for "Viewers" who can only see things. When you assign a role to a user, they inherit the permissions that come with that role.

#### Organizations

_Organizations_ are larger groups that might include multiple users. When you grant permissions to an organization, everyone in that organization gets the specified access.

### Why set permissions?

Setting permissions ensures that only the right people have access to your apps and pages. It's like putting up a virtual fence, allowing you to control who can view or edit your work.

Remember, managing permissions is a powerful way to keep things organized and secure in App Builder. If you ever need to change access, just revisit the permission settings and adjust them accordingly.
