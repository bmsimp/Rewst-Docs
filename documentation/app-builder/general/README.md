# General

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Experimental Feature**

This is an advanced feature that does not offer the same level of support as Rewst's built-in integrations. While we have made efforts to ensure its stability, we recommend caution in using this feature in production environments until further testing and development have been completed.
{% endhint %}

App Builder, when paired with the Rewst automations you know and love, lets you create dynamic web applications— also known as websites— powered by workflows. Apps consist of pages, and pages are made up of components like images, text, forms, tables, and charts.

Rewst hosts your apps for you on a configurable subdomain of Rewst, with custom domains. You're free to fully customize your pages using our drag-and-drop page builder.
