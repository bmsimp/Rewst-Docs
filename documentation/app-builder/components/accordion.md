## Why we developed the accordion component

The accordion is there to help manage and organize information efficiently, particularly when users need to navigate through large sets of data or content. By showing one section at a time, it reduces visual clutter and enables a focused user experience.

## What the accordion component could be used for&#x20;

* Presenting FAQs, where each question expands into a detailed answer
* Organizing grouped content, like features or categories, for better readability
* Cleaner presentation of sidebar menu items.&#x20;
* Collapsing or expanding informational sections on dashboards or reports
* Providing step-by-step instructions, with each step expandable to reveal more details

## **Example use case for the accordion component**

A support website may use an accordion to present frequently asked questions (FAQs). Each question appears as a header, and when clicked, expands to reveal the answer. This lets users focus on a specific question without being distracted by other content.

Another great example of how accordions can be utilized are in the sidebar. By adding accordion components to your sidebar, you can nest the 'Menu' component inside it. This allows you to break your sidebar out into sections (ie: sub-menus), to enhance your app's navigation for your users.&#x20;
