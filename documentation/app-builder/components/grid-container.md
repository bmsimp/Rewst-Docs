## Why we developed the grid container component

The Grid Container component provides a flexible and powerful way to arrange UI elements within a web page. Utilizing a grid system enables designers and developers to place content in a consistent, aligned, and orderly manner, improving both the aesthetics and functionality of the application's interface.

## What the grid container component could be used for

* Creating complex page layouts with multiple sections and alignment.
* Ensuring content is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.
* Aligning components precisely within a page, enhancing the visual structure.
* Organizing text, images, and interactive elements in a clean, navigable format.

## **Example use case for the grid container component**

Imagine a real estate website where property listings need to be displayed in an organized manner. The Grid Container can be used to create a uniform grid layout where each property's image, description, and key details are presented in individual grid cells. This setup allows users to easily compare listings and navigate through options without overwhelming visual clutter, enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Grid container versus container

* **Grid Container Component**: The Grid Container component is specifically designed to create layouts with a grid structure. It simplifies the process of aligning and organizing content in a grid format.
* **Container Component**: The Container component, on the other hand, is a versatile element for structuring content and styling containers. It allows for flexible arrangements but does not enforce a grid structure. More on the container component can be found [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/app-builder/components/container).

## Grid container versus grid item

* **Grid Container Component**: The Grid Container acts as the foundational element of a grid layout. It defines the overall grid structure within which Grid Items are placed. It sets the framework for how the grid behaves and how items within it are aligned and distributed.
* **Grid Item Component**: The Grid Item component is used within a Grid Container to place individual elements like text, images, buttons, etc. It represents the content blocks that fill the grid defined by the Grid Container. More on the grid item component can be found [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/app-builder/components/grid-item).
