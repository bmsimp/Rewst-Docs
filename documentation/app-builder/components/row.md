## Why we developed the row component

The Row component provides a flexible framework for aligning UI elements horizontally across the screen. It is fundamental to creating responsive, grid-based layouts that adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining the integrity of the design.&#x20;

## What the row component could be used for

* Structuring content into horizontal blocks within a webpage.
* Aligning multiple elements, such as buttons, images, or text, within a single horizontal line.
* Creating a base for grid systems that require precise control over the placement and alignment of components.
* Supporting responsive design principles by organizing content in rows that adjust to screen width changes.

## **Example \ use case for the row component**

You could use the Row component on a service overview page to align icons or buttons that link to different IT services you offer, such as cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and network management. Each service could be represented by an icon and a short description in a separate row element, ensuring that the page is easy to scan and that users can quickly find the service they need. This usage not only makes the page visually attractive but also enhances user navigation and improves overall site organization.
