## Why we developed the button component

Buttons are essential interactive elements that facilitate user actions and decision-making processes within applications. They serve as a primary interface component for executing commands and are fundamental to improving user interaction, providing clear, actionable steps for users to take.

## What the button component could be used for

* Submitting forms and collecting user inputs.
* Redirecting users to other sections of the application or external resources.
* Initiating downloads or transactions.
* Triggering various functions defined within the application, such as opening a modal window or starting a workflow.

## **Example use case for the button component**

For an MSPâ€™s internal tool that manages client device setups, a Button component labeled "Deploy Software" could be implemented. This button could initiate a rewst workflow install or update software across client systems. By simplifying complex actions into a single button click, MSPs can ensure consistent software deployments, reduce human error, and increase operational efficiency.
