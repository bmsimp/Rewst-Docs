# Agent Smith

## ![:agentrewsty:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1184572742255779850.webp?size=40\&quality=lossless) Introducing Agent Smith

Built with [GoLang](https://go.dev/) and leveraging Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, Agent Smith is all about keeping things fast, simple, and within your control. Agent Smith steps in to fill any gaps in your ability to execute scripts and syncs smoothly within your workflows.

### Agent Smith features and benefits:

* **Speedy Script Execution:** Overcomes traditional RMM task execution speed challenges.
* **Open Source Customization:** Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rewstapp/agent-smith-go), fully manageable through your Azure Tenant and Rewst workflows.
* **Free and Cost-Effective:** Smaller environments can make use of Azure's free tier, or use a low-cost Standard tier.
* **Easy Setup:** Simple device and service provisioning via Rewst Crates, suitable for domain controllers and endpoints.
* **Secure CI/CD:** Ensures security and validity with automated builds, cryptographic signing, and SHA256 hashing.
* **Seamless Integration:** Agents wait for Rewst messages, fitting effortlessly into existing automations.
* **Rewst Supported:** Our [support team](https://docs.rewst.help/support-and-community/roc-support) will help you get up and going.

### Architecture

* Agent Smith relies on the Microsoft [Azure IoT Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-concepts-and-iot-hub) for the majority of the heavy lifting.
  * The setup process will **automatically** create a single IoT hub instance in **your** Azure environment. If you are servicing customers, there is no need to set up additional instances.
  * All Agents will become registered devices in your IoT Hub, and their connection properties remain within that instance.
  * Agent installation sets the organization id for the Agent to be registered with so that workflows can identify agents according to their Rewst organization.
* Agents will establish a connection to your IoT Hub instance for receiving messages triggered by Rewst workflows. These messages will contain IDs that refer to specific workflow executions that expect shell code to be executed.
  * Your IoT Hub will be established with its own hostname, such as `myiothub.azure-devices.net`
  * The Agents will communicate with the IoT Hub using the MQTT protocol (`tcp/8883`).
* The results of shell code will be sent directly back to Rewst via webhook (HTTP POST) to the workflow executions for processing.
  * The URLs that the agents will be sending data to are ephemeral, single-use paths.
  * They will correspond to the "back-end application handling" hostnames listed in the [Security Page](https://docs.rewst.help/security/security-policy) in the Rewst docs.
* This combination of discrete one-way communication channels separates the message data, removing the requirement for the IoT Hub to have visibility to resulting data. The data is sent only direct to the workflow that requires it via a direct `POST` to an ephemeral URL.

### Requirements

* You will need to obtain your own Microsoft Azure subscription, and integrate it to Rewst at your top-level organization via the Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle. You can refer to our documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/cloud/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle).
* Follow the setup instructions [here](https://docs.rewst.help/community-corner/agent-smith/agent-smith-configuration-overview)

While we're confident Agent Smith won't cause any tech havoc, it's always a good idea to test in a lab environment first.
