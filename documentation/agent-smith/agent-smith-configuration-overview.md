# Agent Smith configuration overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Agent Smith consists of three main components:

* An Open Source agent written in Python in the [Rewst GitHub](https://github.com/RewstApp/rewst_remote_agent)
* The Microsoft [Azure IoTHub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-hub) service
* Rewst Crates to configure the IoTHub and interact with agents

Agent Smith operates as an Azure IoT Hub instance, integrated with Rewst workflows for command communication to endpoint agents. The agent software, running as a Windows Service on devices, registers via a webhook trigger in Rewst, creating an IoT Hub entry and receiving configuration data.

## Set up Agent Smith

{% hint style="warning" %}
For the Azure Integration to work, you’ll need to have an Azure Subscription that includes a Keyvault.
{% endhint %}

1. Install and authorize our Microsoft Cloud Integration Bundle by navigating to **Configuration > Integrations** in the Rewst platform. This bundle contains an integration for Microsoft Azure.&#x20;
   1. Our setup instructions for the bundle can be found [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/cloud/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle).&#x20;
   2. Setup instructions for just the Azure integration can be found [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/cloud/microsoft-cloud-integration-bundle/microsoft-azure/microsoft-azure-integration-setup).&#x20;
2. Navigate to **Crates > Crate Marketplace** in the Rewst platform. \
   NOTE: You'll need to install the below Crates in order for Agent Smith setup to complete.&#x20;
   1.  Search for and install the **Agent Smith: Device Provisioning** Crate.\

3. Navigate to the live **Agent Smith: Service Configuration** form and choose **Action: Create IoT Hub Instance** from the **Action** drop down menu.
4.  Select the proper **Azure Subscription**, **Azure Location**, type in a unique **IoT Hub Name**, and select the desired **IoT Hub Service Tier**.\

5. **Submit** the form and monitor workflow results for success.

### 4. Workaround for installation bug

* Agent Registration Workflow: Update the secret key in the trigger configuration.
  * Open Agent Smith: Agent Registration Workflow.
  * Update the Agent Smith Registration Webhook Trigger.
* In the dropdown selector for Secret Key choose iothub\_registration\_secret

## Provision agents

1. Return to the same **Agent Smith: Service Configuration** form and choose **Display Agent Configuration Instructions**.
2. Choose your **Registration Organization**. The form will display instructions for using PowerShell to configure the Agent for that organization. It also shows how the ORG ID is filled in. If desired, you could use an existing RMM to deploy the agent using variables.\

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only Up-to-date versions of PowerShell have been tested to work. Make sure your devices are updated! We suggest you provision one or a few agents to test with before doing mass provisioning.
{% endhint %}



### Test Agent Smith

1. Return to the form and choose **Run PowerShell Code on Agent**
2. Type some PowerShell code into the **Type your PowerShell Here** field, or use what's pre-filled.
3. Monitor the workflow status to see the agent return data.\

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Agent Smith uses the Microsoft Azure integration. You'll need to add that as an integration override to any workflows which will use it.
* This includes anything that calls the Run PowerShell subworkflows, such as New Employee, etc.
{% endhint %}



### Agent Smith: Track Agent Inventory In Azure Tables Crate

This Crate will add some additional capabilities to your Agent Smith Deployments. Using it is optional.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-07 at 2.57.50 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Crate features include:

* Using Azure Tables to store additional information about your agent endpoints
* Automatic agent data collection check-ins including installed applications and service, via Task Scheduler
* Automatic restart of the agent if the Service stops, via Task Scheduler

## Uninstall Agent Smith

### Windows

Agent Smith installs itself as a service. You can use PowerShell or the SC command to modify or remove the service. Application logs and data are installed in `C:\ProgramData\RewstRemoteAgent` or whatever root path you've overridden that to in you environment. Application Program files are in `%ProgramFiles%\RewstRemoteAgent` folders.

## Troubleshoot Agent Smith

* Ensure admin-level account setup, so the service will install as SYSTEM.
* Verify the recent MS PowerShell version on your devices.
* Ensure that no firewalls are preventing communications with Rewst or your IoT Hub. Check our[Rewst Security Configuration Page](https://docs.rewst.help/security) for details.
* Ensure that endpoint security software is not preventing executions or comms.
* Check device connectivity to Azure IoT Hub via MQTT: `<your_iothub_name>.azure-devices.net:8883`.
* Get packet captures from the agent while workflows are running. This can help us determine if the agent is properly communicating with the IoT Hub and/or the Rewst engine.
