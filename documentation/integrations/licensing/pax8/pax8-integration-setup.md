6. **Accept**. You'll know that the integration was successfully installed if you now see an option to **ReAuthorize**.
7. Beneath that integration authentication section you will see the following options:
   1. **Suggest Values**: This option will attempt to generate mappings between Rewst organizations and child organizations in this integration.
   2. **Refresh Options**: This will re-read the potential mapping options - for both organizations and companies in Pax8.
   3. **Save Mappings**: This will apply mapping configuration changes.

Once saved, Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Now you can make use of Pax8 actions in your workflows!
