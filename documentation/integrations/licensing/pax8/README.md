# Pax8

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of January 31, 2025, Pax8 is retiring API Key requests for Rewst and will require Rewstâ€™s customers to move to OAuth 2.0 to authenticate to their APIs. Rewst customers will need to authenticate with OAuth before January 31 to continue to use our Pax 8 integration.

Our team expects the OAuth changes to be released on December 21, 2024. Full documentation on how to complete your transition can be found [here in our help docs.](pax8-2025-oauth-transition-planning.md)
