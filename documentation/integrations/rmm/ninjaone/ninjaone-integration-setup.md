## What does the NinjaOne integration do?

Our NinjaOne integration provides users with a powerful combination of documentation, remote monitoring, and management capabilities. Seamlessly access and manage NinjaRMM within Rewst, monitor and troubleshoot devices, deploy software, and perform remote tasks more effectively. Use this integration to centralize your IT documentation and RMM workflows, ensuring a comprehensive and streamlined approach to IT management within the Rewst platform.

### Why use the NinjaOne integration?

* Device monitoring and management
* Execute scripts on endpoints
* Deploy software to devices

## Set up the NinjaOne Integration

### Set up steps in NinjaOne

1. Navigate to **Administration > Library > Automation**.
2. Click **Add**, then **New Script**.
3. Add the following script:
   1. Name: Rewst (Windows)
   2. Language: Powershell
   3. OS: Windows
   4. Architecture: All
   5. Paste the code below into the script box

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Rewst Base URL will vary depending on which Rewst instance you are on. You must update the $rewst\_base\_url property in the script below to match your Rewst Instance. You can identify which instance you are on by the URL you use to access Rewst. Please use the following table as a guide to identify your Rewst Base URL
{% endhint %}

| Rewst URL       | Base URL           |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| app.rewst.io    | engine.rewst.io    |
| app.eu.rewst.io | engine.eu.rewst.io |
| app.rewst.eu    | engine.rewst.eu    |
| app.rewst.asia  | engine.rewst.asia  |

```powershell
Param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$script_content_path,
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$results_postdata_path
)

$rewst_base_url = "https://INSERTBASEURLHERE/webhooks/custom/action"
$script_content_url = "$rewst_base_url/$script_content_path"
$post_url = "$rewst_base_url/$results_postdata_path"



# Download Script Content from Rewst

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$wc.Encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$commands = ($wc.DownloadString($script_content_url))

# Execute Script Content

1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Name your workflow, and click **Submit**.
4. Drag a Ninja action onto your workflow builder canvas. In this example, we use **List Contacts**.\

## Troubleshoot the NinjaOne integration

### All List component actions fail.

If any list action is failing, ensure that you have added the script in previous instructions, into NinjaOne.
