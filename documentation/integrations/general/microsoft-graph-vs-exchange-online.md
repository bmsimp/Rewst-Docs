## Group Types

Here's a breakdown of the group types and their corresponding management methods:

1. #### Dynamic Membership Groups:
   * Dynamic membership groups are identified by the presence of "Dynamic membership" in the group type property. These groups cannot be directly modified through APIs.
2. #### Unified Groups:
   * Unified groups are managed using Microsoft Graph API. They are groups where "unified" is present in the group types property or when mail-enabled is set to false.
3. #### Security Groups:
   * Security groups can be managed using Exchange Online if mail-enabled is set to true. If mail-enabled is false, they are managed by Microsoft Graph API.
4. #### Distribution Groups:
   * Distribution groups are also managed using Exchange Online.

### Conclusion

By understanding the nuances of different group types and mapping them appropriately, you can efficiently handle group operations within your applications.&#x20;
