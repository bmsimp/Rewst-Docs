## What does the Webroot integration do?

Our Webroot integration enables automation of endpoint and license management. Use the Webroot Unity API within Rewst workflows to manage sites, users, policies, endpoints, GSM console access and more.

### Integration use cases

* Enhanced security monitoring capabilities integrated into daily workflows
* Automated reporting and alerts based on antivirus activities and findings
