## Integration use cases

* Automation of endpoint security management - deploy, update, and monitor security software across devices
* Threat detection and response automation - Detect threats and trigger alerts without manual intervention
* Policy enforcement and compliance monitoring - Automate compliance checks and generate security reports

## Test the Integration

Saving your configuration during integration setup automatically triggers a test API call to verify that your setup is correct. If something is wrong with your credentials and the integration fails, you'll receive an error message in the Rewst platform.
