## What does the Nodeware integration do?

Our Nodeware integration enhances automation capabilities in network vulnerability management. Automatically identify, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities across networks, and access vulnerability reporting from within your PSA.

## Set up the Nodeware integration

### Set up steps in Nodeware

1. Log in to your Nodeware account.
2. Click on **Reports** in the left side menu.
3. Copy the **API Key,** displayed in the lower right corner. You'll need this value to authenticate your API calls.\

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the Integrations page, search for the Nodeware integration.\

3. Paste the API key copied from Nodeware into the **API Key** field of the form.
4.  Click **Save Configuration**.\

5.  Once your configuration is saved, you'll see a new **Organization Mapping** menu at the bottom of your screen. \

## Test the Integration

Saving your configuration during integration setup automatically triggers a test API call to verify that your setup is correct. If something is wrong with your credentials and the integration fails, you'll receive an error message in the Rewst platform.\
