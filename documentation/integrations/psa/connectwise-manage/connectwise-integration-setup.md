# ConnectWise integration setup

{% hint style="success" %}
**This Integration supports multiple instances**

[Check out the instructions to set up multiple instances here](../../general/multi-instance-integration/multi-instance-integration-setup.md).
{% endhint %}

## What does the ConnectWise PSA integration do?

### Integration use cases

Here’s just a taste of what you can automate with relevant Crates, after you've set up your ConnectWise PSA integration:

* Add your child organizations, also known as customers, to Rewst.
* User onboarding and offboarding
* Categorize tickets using OpenAI

## Integration prerequisites

Rewst has a number of tasks that can be performed using the ConnectWise Manage API, all of which require different permissions. You can review the [ConnectWise Manage Security Roles Matrix](https://developer.connectwise.com/@api/deki/files/422/Security_Roles_Matrix_11132017.xlsx?revision=1) for more information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Other Configurations**

Once the integration has been configured within Rewst, we can use the Rewst Crate: Configure Organization Variables to configure your own custom settings and how Rewst should interact with ConnectWise PSA. Our Guide for that Crate can be found here: [_Configure Organization Variable_](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/existing-crate-documentation/configure-organization-variables)[_s_](../../../../prebuilt-automations/existing-crate-documentation/configure-organization-variables.md)

Note that this form asks for information about your RMM / M365 settings as well. While this form can be completed again separately, we recommend that you also set up the integration for Microsoft Graph and your RMM at this same time.
