## What does the Lexful integration do?

Our Lexful integration enables the automation of IT documentation management. Use the Lexful API within Rewst workflows to manage entities, organizations, users, labels, and entity types through a flexible schema-driven API with built-in search, revision history, and access control.

## Set up the Lexful integration

### Set up steps in Lexful

1. Navigate to your [Lexful Dashboard](https://app.lexful.com/) and log in with your account credentials.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Account Settings > APIs** .
3. Enter `Rewst` into the **API key name** **field**.
4. Click **Generate API Key**
5. Copy the **API Key ID**, **Account ID**, and **API Key Secret** and store these values somewhere secure. You'll need them for further steps in Rewst. Note that the secret will only be displayed once, and can't be retrieved again after you navigate away from the page.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Marketplace > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. Search for `Lexful` in the integrations page.
3. Click on the integration tile to launch setup.
4. Enter the information copied from Lexful into the relevant fields:
   1. **API Key ID**&#x20;
   2. **API Key Secret**&#x20;
   3. **Account ID**
5. Enter the **Base URL**:
   * **Production**: `https://api.lexful.com` - default, use this for most integrations
   * **UAT**: `https://api.uat.lexful.net` - for testing, only use this if you are certain it applies to your instance of Lexful
6. Click **Save Configuration**.
7. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input. Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;
