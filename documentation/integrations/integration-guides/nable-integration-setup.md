## What does the N-able N-central integration do?

Our N-able N-central integration allows MSPs to seamlessly interact with N-central's powerful RMM capabilities through Rewst, facilitating device management, task automation, and efficient operational workflows.

### Integration use cases

* Automatically synchronize device and customer data with your Rewst workflows.
* Execute and manage scheduled tasks directly from Rewst.
* Run automated Powershell scripts remotely to maintain and configure devices.

## Integration prerequisites

* N-able N-central version 2023.9 or above
* A dedicated API user created in N-able N-central
* A JSON web token from N-able N-central
* Powershell scripts configured for API access in N-able N-central
* Defined organization variables in Rewst

## Set up the N-able N-central integration

Set up steps in N-able N-central

1. Navigate to **Administration > User Management > Users**.\
   \
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.03.55@2x.jpg>)
2. Click **Create User** to create a new user specifically for API access. Name the user something that will easily identify its purpose.
3. Assign appropriate permissions required for your automations On the **Access Groups and Roles** tabs.
   1. **Roles**: Create a role under **user management > roles** for a full API user. Name it administrator and set all the properties to manage. A reference sheet can be found here under [N-able API user permissions](https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/User_Management/Role%20Based%20Permissions/role_based_permissions_API_user.htm).
   2. **Access Groups**: Set this to **All**.
4. Click the **User Details** tab. Click **User Information**.
5. Check **MFA Not Required** to on.\
   \
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 10.54.36 AM.png>)
6. Click into the **API Access** tab.
7. Check **API Only User** to on.
8. Click **Save**.
9. Click **Generate JSON Web Token**.
10. Securely copy the generated API key. You’ll need this information for the next setup steps in Rewst.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Marketplace > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. Search for `N-able N-central` in the integrations page.\
   \
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.12.59.jpg>)
3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. Under **Parameters**, enter the information copied from N-able N-central into its relevant field:
   1. **API Key:** The JSON Web Token generated on the API user you created
   2. **Base URL:** The base URL of your N-able N-central environment, e.g `rewst.n-able.com` if different from the resource server hostname
5. Click **Save Configuration**.
6. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input.Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.

### Run Powershell via RMM: Script setup

To run Powershell on devices via the RMM, you must create the script in your N-able repository and enable its access for use over the API, as per N-able security policies.

{% hint style="info" %}
To complete all the needed script setup steps in N-able N-central, you'll need to be assigned their Default Administrator Role.
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Scheduled Tasks > Script/Software Repository** in N-able.
2. Click **Add > Scripting**.\
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-07-24 at 12.07.14 PM.png>)
3. Name the script `Rewst (Powershell)`.
4. Enter `Executes Powershell sent via API from Rewst` into the **Description** field.
5. Download the provided PS1 file from the bottom of this instruction section. Update your Powershell script's `$rewst_base_url` variable to match your Rewst Instance URL, using the table provided at the bottom of this section. You can identify which instance you are on by referencing the URL you use to access Rewst. The content of the **Command Line Parameters** field will automatically populate when you upload the file.\
   Example of correct base URL: `https://engine.rewst.io/webhooks/custom/action`
6. Click **Browse** to upload the edited file into N-able N-central.
7. Click **Ok**.
8.  Navigate to **Configuration > Scheduled Tasks > Script/Software Repository.**<br>

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (81) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
9. Enable **API Access** for the script.
10. Note the **Repository ID**.
11. In Rewst, [create an organization variable](../organization-variables.md#manually-add-a-new-organization-variable) named `nable_rewst_powershell_script_id` with the Repository ID as its value. Set this organization variable as default.

| Rewst URL        | Base URL            |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| app.rewst.io     | engine.rewst.io     |
| app.pdx.rewst.io | engine.pdx.rewst.io |
| app.eu.rewst.io  | engine.eu.rewst.io  |
| app.rewst.eu     | engine.rewst.eu     |
| app.rewst.asia   | engine.rewst.asia   |

{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/run-nable-powershell.ps1" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The org variable is only currently required as there is no way to search for a script with the existing API endpoints.
{% endhint %}

## Use custom PowerShell scripts with your RMM integration

If you're writing custom PowerShell scripts to use and be run with your RMM integration, you'll need to manually add webhook calls. Any custom script will time out if used without first adding the webhook calls. The use of standard built-in Rewst scripts with your RMM does not require you to add the calls.

* The webhook calls everyone doing this custom scripting should use will always be as follows.

```

### Send all the data back to RewstyRewst ###



$postData = $PS_Results | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri $post_url -Body $postData -ContentType 'application/json; 
charset=utf-8'
```

1. Navigate to **Automation > Workflows** in Rewst.
2. Create a new workflow and name it with something short and descriptive, such as `Test N-able Integration`.
3. Add the action **List Agents** to the workflow builder canvas, by dragging it from the left pane.\
   \
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.28.49.jpg>)
4. Add a trigger to your test workflow by clicking <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-21 at 11.13.39 AM.png" alt="" data-size="line">. Name your trigger whatever you’d like.
5. Click into the trigger’s settings.
6. Toggle **Enabled** to on.\
   \
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.29.17.jpg>)
7. Set the Trigger Type to **Core - Always Pass**.
8. Click ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 6.14.27 PM.png>) next to **Integration Overrides**. Add **N-able N-central** as your integration override.\
   \
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.29.51.jpg>)
9. In the **Activate Trigger To Run For** section, keep **Selected Organization** toggled on. Toggle **All current and future managed organizations** on, or choose just one or individually selected organizations from the **Organizations** drop-down selector.\
   \
   ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.30.35.jpg>)
10. Click **Submit** to save your trigger.
11. Click **Publish** to save your changes.
12. Click Test to run your workflow. Note that this will bring up a drop-down selector to choosing organizations.
13. Select your MSP level.
14. Click **Test** and confirm that the execution finishes without errors.\
    <br>

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.31.20.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
15. If the test for your MSP is successful, do the same test again. At this point in your steps, select a client organization instead, and ensure that it finishes with no errors.

## Troubleshoot the N-able N-central integration

* **API authentication errors**: Verify JSON Web Token permissions and validity.
* **PowerShell script execution issues**: Check script API access permissions in N-able.

## Current limitations

There is currently no way to identify a domain controller via the N-able REST API. You must manually set the hostname of the preferred DC. Do this using the organization variable form that was discussed during your onboarding. The end result will be an organizational variable called **preferred\_domain\_controller** and a value of the hostname of that client's DC.
