# Integrations

## What is an integration?

Integrations are a core part of Rewst. Simply put, an integration is the successful linking of the Rewst platform and a separate tool, to allow the free back and forth flow of information between platform and tool.

Integrations are achieved with a variety of setup steps that will differ depending on the type of tool—PSA versus RMM, for example—and brand of tool type.

## Why use integrations?

Once you’ve set up an integration, you can unpack Crates to achieve automations that depend on those integrated tools.

More on Crates and how unpacking works can be found in our Crate documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/prebuilt-automations/crates).

## Custom integrations

If Rewst doesn’t have an integration for your particular tool, you have the option to build one custom. Any tool that has an API can be integrated with Rewst via custom integration. We recommend that new Rewst users start with stock integrations, and complete all training in Cluck University before attempting custom integration builds.

Our intro to custom integrations can be found [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/custom-integrations). Information on how to set up custom integrations can be found [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations/custom-integrations/custom-integrations-v2).

## View integrations in Rewst

Access integrations that are both installed and available for installation in the Rewst platform by navigating to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu.

### View installed integrations

Uninstall any installed integration by clicking the ⋮ on its integration tile. You’ll be asked to confirm that you want to **Delete** the integration in a new dialogue. Click on any installed integration tile to view its configuration page.

## Get more integrations

{% hint style="warning" %}
Clicking on any of the available integrations under the Get Installed Integrations section will automatically begin that installation.
{% endhint %}

Each of our integrations has a separate integration setup guide, organized by type of integrated tool in this documentation site under the **Documentation > Integrations** section of the left side documentation menu.

In the Rewst platform, search for any of Rewst’s integrations in the Find Integrations search bar at the top right of the Integrations page.

Click the **+New** button to reveal two options for how to set up a custom integration:

1. **New Integration**
2. **Add OpenAPI Integration**

Alternatively, you can kickoff the custom integration setup process by clicking **+ Add New Integration** further down the page in the **Get More Integrations** section.
