# N-able N-central integration setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
**N-central Required Version**

The new REST API endpoints are only available on N-central with a version of 2023.9 or above. Contact your N-able Representative to be upgraded where applicable.
{% endhint %}

## What does the N-able N-central integration do?

Our N-able N-central integration allows MSPs to seamlessly interact with N-central's powerful RMM capabilities through Rewst, facilitating device management, task automation, and efficient operational workflows.

### Integration use cases

* Automatically synchronize device and customer data with your Rewst workflows.
* Execute and manage scheduled tasks directly from Rewst.
* Run automated Powershell scripts remotely to maintain and configure devices.

## Integration prerequisites

* N-able N-central version 2023.9 or above
* A dedicated API user created in N-able N-central
* A JSON web token from N-able N-central
* Powershell scripts configured for API access in N-able N-central
* Defined organization variables in Rewst

## Set up the N-able N-central integration

Set up steps in N-able N-central

1. Navigate to **Administration > User Management > Users**.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.03.55@2x.jpg>)
2. Click **Create User** to create a new user specifically for API access. Name the user something that will easily identify its purpose.
3. Assign appropriate permissions required for your automations On the **Access Groups and Roles** tabs.
   1. **Roles**: Create a role under **user management > roles** for a full API user. Name it administrator and set all the properties to manage. A reference sheet can be found here under [N-able API user permissions](https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/User_Management/Role%20Based%20Permissions/role_based_permissions_API_user.htm).
   2. **Access Groups**: Set this to **All**.
4. Click the **User Details** tab. Click **User Information**.
5. Check **MFA Not Required** to on.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 10.54.36 AM.png>)
6. Click into the **API Access** tab.
7. Check **API Only User** to on.
8. Click **Save**.
9. Click **Generate JSON Web Token**.
10. Securely copy the generated API key. You’ll need this information for the next setup steps in Rewst.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the Integrations page, search for the N-able N-central integration.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.12.59.jpg>)
3. Click on the integration tile to launch the **Configuration** setup page.
4. Fill out the form with the details you created:
   1. **API Key:** The JSON Web Token generated on the API user you created
   2. **Base URL:** The base URL of your N-able N-central environment e.g `rewst.n-able.com` if different from the resource server hostname.
5. Save the configuration. Rewst will do a quick validation of your input.

{% hint style="info" %}
Beneath that integration authentication section you’ll see the following options:

1. **Suggest Values**: This option will attempt to generate mappings between Rewst organizations and child organizations in this integration.
2. **Refresh Options**: This will re-read the potential mapping options - both organizations and companies in N-able.
3. **Save Mappings** This will apply mapping configuration changes.
{% endhint %}



### Running Powershell via RMM - Script Setup

In order to run Powershell on devices via the RMM, you must create the Script in your N-able repository and enable its access for use over the API, as per N-able Security Policies.

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Scheduled Tasks > Script/Software Repository** in N-able.
2. Click **Add > Scripting**.
3. Name the script **Rewst (Powershell)**.
4. Enter a script description.
5. Download and upload the provided PS1 file.
6. Enable **API Access** for the script.
7. Note the **Repository ID**.
8.  In Rewst, create an organization variable named **nable\_rewst\_powershell\_script\_id** with the Repository ID as its value.

    Update your Powershell script's `$rewst_base_url` variable to match your Rewst Instance URL:

| Rewst URL        | Base URL            |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| app.rewst.io     | engine.rewst.io     |
| app.pdx.rewst.io | engine.pdx.rewst.io |
| app.eu.rewst.io  | engine.eu.rewst.io  |
| app.rewst.eu     | engine.rewst.eu     |
| app.rewst.asia   | engine.rewst.asia   |

{% file src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/run-nable-powershell (2).ps1" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The ORG Var is only currently required as there is no way to search for a script with the existing API Endpoints
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Once imported, you must update your script's $rewst\_base\_url variable. Your Rewst Base URL will vary depending on which Rewst instance you are on. You must update the $rewst\_base\_url property in the script below to match your Rewst Instance. You can identify which instance you are on by the URL you use to access Rewst. Please use the following table as a guide to identify your Rewst Base URL
{% endhint %}

## Test the Integration

1. Navigate to **Automation > Workflows** in Rewst.
2. Create a new workflow and name it with something short and descriptive, such as `Test N-able Integration`.
3. Add the action **List Agents** to the workflow builder canvas, by dragging it from the left pane.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.28.49.jpg>)
4. Add a trigger to your test workflow by clicking <img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-21 at 11.13.39 AM (2).png" alt="" data-size="line">. Name your trigger whatever you’d like.
5. Click into the trigger’s settings.
6. Toggle **Enabled** to on.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.29.17.jpg>)
7. Set the Trigger Type to **Core - Always Pass**.
8. Click ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 6.14.27 PM (1).png>) next to **Integration Overrides**. Add **N-able N-central** as your integration override.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.29.51.jpg>)
9. In the **Activate Trigger To Run For** section, keep **Selected Organization** toggled on. Toggle **All current and future managed organizations** on, or choose just one or individually selected organizations from the **Organizations** drop-down selector.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.30.35.jpg>)
10. Click **Submit** to save your trigger.
11. Click **Publish** to save your changes.
12. Click Test to run your workflow. Note that this will bring up a drop-down selector to choosing organizations.
13. Select your MSP level.
14. Click **Test** and confirm that the execution finishes without errors.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-31 at 19.31.20.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
15. If the test for your MSP is successful, do the same test again. At this point in your steps, select a client organization instead, and ensure that it finishes with no errors.

## Troubleshoot the N-able N-central integration

* **API Authentication Errors**: Verify JSON Web Token permissions and validity.
* **Powershell Script Execution Issues**: Check script API access permissions in N-able.

## Current Limitations

There is currently no way to identify a Domain Controller via the N-able REST API. You must manually set the hostname of the preferred DC. Do this using the organization variable form that was discussed during your onboarding. The end result will be an organizational variable called **preferred\_domain\_controller** and a value of the hostname of that client's DC.
