## What does the Slide integration do?

Our Slide integration enables MSPs to automate critical backup and disaster recovery operations using Rewst workflows. By integrating with Slide.tech, users can streamline tasks such as agent deployment, pre- and post-update backups, system verification, and monitoring. This ensures systems are always protected, reduces manual overhead, and improves responsiveness to backup issues or system outages.

### Why use the Slide integration?

Common uses include:

* Automatically installing the Slide agent on new or reprovisioned systems
* Initiating backups before and after scheduled software updates to create restore points
* Verifying that updates were successfully applied and flagging discrepancies
* Monitoring offline endpoints and spinning up resources that have remained inactive
* Detecting backup failures and triggering escalations or automated remediation steps

## Set up the Slide integration

### Set up steps in Slide

1. Log in to your [Slide Console](https://console.slide.tech/).
2. Navigate to **My Settings** **> API**.
3.  Click **+ CREATE API TOKEN**.\
    \

4. Enter a name that lets you know the token is being used for Rewst into the **Name** field of the dialog that appears.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Copy the API token. Note that the token will only be displayed once, and cannot be retrieved once the dialog is closed. You'll need this token for the rest of the set up steps in Rewst.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the integrations page, search for the `Slide` integration.\
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 3.30.55 PM.png>)\

3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. Paste the API token copied from Slide into the **API Token** field.
5. Click **Save Configuration**.

## Test the integration

Saving your configuration during integration setup automatically triggers a test API call to verify that your setup is correct. If something is wrong with your credentials and the integration fails, you'll receive an error message in the Rewst platform.
