## What does the Cove integration do?

Our Cove integration links N-able’s Cove Data Protection with Rewst, to automate and manage data protection tasks within your Rewst workflows. Use the N-able Cove API to create, read, update, or delete backup jobs, monitor backup statuses, and access detailed reporting functionalities.

### Why use the Cove integration?

* Billing reconciliation
* Onboarding of customers and devices
* Self documentation
* Automating actions on backup failure

## Integration prerequisites

The user that will be used to authenticate with Cove API must have API Authentication enabled within Cove.
