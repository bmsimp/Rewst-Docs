## What does the Asana integration do?

Our Asana integration connects Rewst’s automation capabilities with Asana’s powerful project and task management platform. It automates task assignments, project tracking, status updates, and reporting—helping MSPs and business teams reduce manual effort, improve collaboration, and ensure efficient execution of their workflows.

## Set up the Asana integration

### Set up steps in Asana

1. Log in to Asana.
2. Navigate to **Account > Settings**.\

6. Check off the **I agree to the Asana API Terms box**.
7. Click **Create Token**.
8. Copy the access token value. Note that once you click out of the display dialog, you won't be able to come back and view this token again. Click **Done** once copied.\

9. Paste the following URL into your browser's address bar, while still logged in to Asana: [https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/users/me](https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/users/me) .
10. Find the GID in the code that appears. Copy the GID. You'll need this to continue setup in Rewst.\

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the Integrations page, search for `Asana`.\

3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. Click **Authorize** under the **Parameters** submenu. If authorization is successful, you'll see a green confirmation message. The **Authorize** button will change to now say **Re-Authorize**.
5. Click **Save Configuration**.
6. A new **Organization Mapping** section will appear at the bottom of the configuration page. You may now begin mapping your organizations.\


## Test the Integration

Saving your configuration during integration setup automatically triggers a test API call to verify that your setup is correct. If something is wrong with your credentials and the integration fails, you'll receive an error message in the Rewst platform.\
