# Proofpoint integration setup

{% hint style="success" %}
**This integration supports multiple instances**

[Check out the instructions to set up multiple instances here](../../multi-instance-integration/multi-instance-integration-setup.md).
{% endhint %}

## Set up steps in Proofpoint

{% hint style="warning" %}
ProofPoint API tokens can only be generated by users assigned to a role with both Integrations and Security Events permissions.
{% endhint %}

1. Log in to your Proofpoint portal.
2. Navigate to **Account Management > Integrations > Security Integrations > Proofpoint API**.
3. Generate an **API Password**.&#x20;
4. Copy the password and store it somewhere secure. You'll need this information for further set up steps in Rewst.

## Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. Search for `Proofpoint` in the integrations page.
3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-17 at 4.54.40â€¯PM.png>)
4. Enter the following information into the relevant fields under **Parameters**:
   1. **Domain**: Your primary domain in ProofPoint
   2. **Username**: ProofPoint API Username - this must be a channel admin user in ProofPoint
   3. **Proofpoint API Password**: The generated API password
   4. **Tenant Hostname**: the regional tenant hostname
5. Click **Save**.

Rewst will do a quick validation of your input.

Once completed, you'll see a new section beneath the configuration form for[ organization mapping](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations#what-is-organization-mapping). Complete your mapping as desired.&#x20;
