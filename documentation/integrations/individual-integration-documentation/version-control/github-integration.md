# GitHub integration

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re new to integrations in Rewst, read through our introductory integration documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations).

GitHub’s own documentation for registering an app can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app).
{% endhint %}

## What does the GitHub integration do?

Our GitHub integration enables automation of GitHub’s version control system. Use GitHub’s API within Rewst workflows to automate aspects of version control in GitHub.

### Integration use cases

* Say you want to create a Crate that automatically backs up all workflow exports any time they change. You could use the GitHub integration to make a commit of each change of the file. This would give you a more fully featured option than Rewst’s built in version control.
* Use this integration to set up a system for sharing workflows you’ve created with other Rewst customers. Create a public repository, and post exported repositories of your shareable workflows.

## Set up the GitHub integration

### Set up steps in GitHub

1. Log in to the GitHub account linked to your organization.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the Integrations page, search for the GitHub integration.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 10.06.23 AM.png>)
3. Click the integration tile to launch the **Configuration** setup page.
4. Enter the following in the relevant fields of the form:
   1. The **Name** that will be used to refer to the integration configuration
   2. **Description**: this is optional.
   3. Check the **Is Default** checkbox.
   4. **Organization Name**: make sure that this is exact to how your organization name appears in GitHub.
5. Click **Save Configuration**.
6. Click **Authorize**.
7. Click **Continue** next to your desired installation location, from the list in the dialog that appears. The dialog will contain a list of organizations. It’s important that you choose the organization to match the one you entered for the organization name of the Rewst configuration form.\

8. Click **Install & Authorize**.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-10 at 5.13.32 PM.png>)
9. A green confirmation message will appear at the top of your screen. Now, the configuration form will have an option to **Re-Authorize**.

## Test the Integration

Whenever you save configuration and reauthorize, Rewst will run a test action to make sure the integration is working.\

For additional testing, click the Refresh Options button under the Organization Mapping section of the integration configuration page. This will return a list of repositories accessible by that organization.

## Troubleshoot the GitHub integration

{% hint style="warning" %}
The below error may also happen if you attempt to install the GitHub integration on multiple Rewst orgs using the same GitHub org.

If you encounter any errors, contact us in your Discord support channel for assistance.
{% endhint %}

If you uninstall the GitHub integration in Rewst but don’t uninstall our GitHub App in your organization, any attempt to re-install and authorize the integration will fail, and you’ll be stuck at this screen:\

To fix this failure:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Find the installed GitHub App.
3. Click the **Configure** button.
4. Uninstall the app. You should now be able to re-authorize in Rewst, and the GitHub App will be reinstalled once successful.
