# Pod configuration

ConnectWise Pods are a great method of getting information from Rewst into different areas within ConnectWise Manage, such as service desk tickets.

**Pod Authorization**

Note that pods do not allow the use of the fat client due to authorization pass-through issues. This means that you can use the web client to access pods.
{% endhint %}

### Configure ConnectWise pods

To configure the connection between your pods and Rewst, follow the below steps.

1. Login to ConnectWise Manage as a user that has access to the Setup Tables. This is likely an admin account.
2. Click the **System** icon on the bottom left of the ConnectWise Manage UI.
3. Click on the **Setup Tables** menu that appears.
4. Enter `\*api\` in the table filter. Your returned result should be **Manage Hosted API**.
5. Click **Add** and use the below settings:
   1. **Description** - Enter **Rewst**
   2. **Screen** - For our example, we use **Service Tickets**
   3. **Origin** - [https://app.rewst.io](https://app.rewst.io)
   4. **URL** - [https://app.rewst.io/organizations/\<org\_id>/integrations/embed/ticket/\[cw\_id\]](https://app.rewst.io/organizations/%3Corg_id%3E/integrations/embed/ticket/\[cw_id)
6. Select **Pod**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Update the URL**

You will need to add your own `org_id`to the URL above. This can be obtained by going to Rewst and looking at the URL. `[cw_id]`should be left as-is.
{% endhint %}

### Add pods to tickets

1. Click the **Settings** icon in the top right corner of your screen.
2. Select **Pod Configuration**.

**Firefox Dynamic State Partitioning**

An issue arises with Firefox's Dynamic State Partitioning where the default `network.cookie.cookieBehavior` value of 5 rejects (known) trackers and partitions third-party storage, hindering the authentication process and causing a logged GraphQL error. This issue also occurs with embedded forms.

Firefox users must set `network.cookie.cookieBehavior` to 4 for successful pod authentication.

Consult the official Firefox documentation for more information: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State\_Partitioning#disable\_dynamic\_state\_partitioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning#disable_dynamic_state_partitioning).\\

You'll have a workflow called `[Rewst Master v3] Pods: Technician Toolbox` within your organization.

### Re-run a pod from a ticket

Let's imagine you have a ticket that has had its associated pod workflow execution expire (or fail for one reason or another). If you attempt to view the pod in the ticket you'll see something along the lines of:&#x20;

To execute a new instance of the pod, click on the **Links** dropdown in the ticket and choose **Rewst - Start Pod on this Ticket**.

After you have used this button, a web page will open and close. This will send a request to the Live Link trigger and start a new execution for that ticket. Allow some time to pass for the ticket to update. You should see the pod populate once the execution has gone through.
