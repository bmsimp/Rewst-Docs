## What does the Kaseya BMS integration do?

Our Kaseya BMS integration enables the automation of ticket creation, updates, and management directly from workflows, ensuring seamless synchronization between service requests and business operations. It allows for automated time entry and billing updates, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. If desired, the integration could trigger Rewst workflows based on ticket events.

### Why use the Kaseya BMS integration?

* Automatically trigger workflows based on specific ticket types, updates, or subjects. By leveraging designated trigger types, you can pass ticket data directly into workflows, ensuring you have access to the necessary information exactly when you need it.
* Log workflow results at key stages, enabling Helpdesk staff to quickly and easily track the progress of workflows, such as onboarding processes.
* Add internal and external notes, allowing you to run automations and show information only to those who need it.
* Integrate seamlessly with AI, Using our AI integrations you can leverage the power of OpenAi and Azure OpenAi to set ticket categories and sentiment or even suggest steps for your team to take.
* Create Ticket Time Entries, eliminating manual data entry, ensuring accurate time tracking, improving billing efficiency, and enhancing SLA compliance—boosting productivity while reducing human error.
* Import all PSA customers into Rewst, streamlining initial setup and saving valuable time.

## Integration prerequisites

Rewst requires an OTP token to access the Kaseya BMS API. You’ll need to create a regular user account, as Kaseya doesn't allow OTP Tokens to be generated on API users.

## Set up the Kaseya BMS integration

### Set up steps in Kaseya BMS

1. Log in to Kaseya BMS with an administrative account.
2. Navigate to **Admin > HR > Employees**.
3.  Click +**New**.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (53) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4. Create your new user with an easily identifiable name. Set the user type to **Employee**. Use the **Administrator** security role to ensure that the API has the necessary permissions for Rewst to integrate seamlessly. Note that you must use a valid email address to set up this account. That email will be used for further setup steps later in the process.\

5. Log out of your current Kaseya sessions. Log in as the newly created user.
6. Navigate to **My Profile**. As this is your first time logging in, Kaseya should display this page at login.
7.  Click **Enable MFA**.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (55) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
8. Click **Show secret key for manual configuration** in the dialog that appears. Copy and save this code, which you’ll need to finish setup in Rewst.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (56) (1).png>)
9. Configure MFA with your preferred app.
10. Click **Enable**.

### Set up steps in Rewst

1. Navigate to **Configuration > Integrations** in the left side menu of your Rewst platform.
2. In the Integrations page, search for the `Kaseya BMS` integration.
3. Click on the integration tile to launch setup.\
   \
   ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 12.29.33 PM.png>)
4.  Enter all details into their relevant fields:

    * **Name**: Can be left as default but changed if you wish
    * **Description**: Can be left blank but populate if you wish
    * **Is Default**: Most situations will call for this to be left ticked, this is for if you have multiple instances.
    * **Hostname**: This is the hostname of your BMS instance preceded by api, you can find this in the URL bar
    * **Password**: The password for your newly create BMS user
    * **Tenant**: This is the name of the parent org in BMS, if you are unsure this will be on the welcome email received when setting up the new users and will be marked as “Company”
    * **TOTP Secret**: This is the code we saved during the MFA setup
    * **Username**: The username we created in BMS

    \
    ![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png>)
5.  Click **Save Configuration**. You should see the following confirmation message display if your setup has completed properly.\
    \

6. This step will vary depending on if you have set up your customers in Rewst.
   1. If you have not setup your customers in Rewst, unpack the [Bulk Create Client from PSA Crate](../../../../../prebuilt-automations/existing-crate-documentation/bulk-create-client-from-psa-crate.md).
   2. If you have already set up customers or imported clients, scrolling down on the integration page will display a list of your customers.
      1. Click **Refresh Options** if you have already imported your customers via PSA integration, but are not seeing a correct list.
      2. Click **Suggest Values** to match between Rewst organization and Kaseya BMS customers. Note that if the names are not exactly the same, they may be excluded. Use the drop-down selector to choose the correct organization and fix this mismatch.
7. Click **Save Mappings** to complete your integration setup.

## Test the integration

Successful organization importing via the Bulk Create Client from PSA Crate is a good indication that the integration is working as expected. If your organizations were imported by other methods, run this test to ensure that the integration is fully functional.

1. Navigate to **Automations > Workflows**.
2. Click **Create**.
3.  Name your workflow `Kaseya BMS Test`, and click **Submit**. Note that this workflow is just to test the integration, and can be deleted after the test is complete.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (57) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
4. Search for `Kaseya BMS` in the actions menu of your workflow builder.
5.  Drag and drop the **List accounts** action on to the workflow builder canvas.\
    \


    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (58) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
6. Click **Test** in the top right corner of the workflow builder. If all is working after the test, the task's highlight will turn green.
