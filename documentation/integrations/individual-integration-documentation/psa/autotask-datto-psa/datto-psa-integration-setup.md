## What does the Datto Autotask integration do?

Our Datto Autotask integration enables seamless synchronization of ticketing, client data, and service management workflows between Autotask and Rewst. It allows MSPs to automate repetitive tasks like ticket creation, status updates, and client information syncing, reducing manual effort and improving operational efficiency.

### Why use the Datto Autotask integration?

#### Automate ticket creation

A critical server outage alert is triggered in your RMM tool. Rewst detects the alert, and **creates a high-priority ticket in** Autotask with details like impacted client, server ID, and error logs. It assigns the ticket to the infrastructure Team based on the ticket category, and triggers a Slack or Teams alert to the assigned team with a direct link to the Autotask ticket

#### Contract renewal automation

A client’s managed services contract is nearing expiration in Autotask. Rewst identifies expiring contracts and triggers a renewal workflow. It generates a quote in Autotask, emails it to the client, schedules a follow-up task for the account manager, and updates the contract status to **Renewal Pending** in Autotask.

#### Client onboarding and offboarding

A new client signs up for managed services. Rewst creates the client’s Autotask account, assigns contracts, and configures service templates. It provisions user accounts in Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace via integrated workflows, then triggers an onboarding checklist for the service team in Autotask.

#### Asset and configuration management

A new firewall is deployed, Rewst **creates a configuration item (CI) in Autotask** with details like serial number, warranty date, and network role, then links the CI to the client’s Autotask profile and updates your documentation platform (eg. IT Glue documentation), and schedules warranty renewal reminders in Autotask.

## Set up the Datto Autotask integration

### Set up steps in Datto Autotask

1. Log into Autotask PSA as an Administrator
2. Navigate to **Admin > Account Settings & Users.**
3. Click to expand the **Resources/Users (HR)** accordion menu.
4. Scroll down the page to the **Security** menu. Click **Security Levels**. Here there should be an API user with the security level of **system.** It has the appropriate administrator privileges to allow for the full functionality of the automations. Datto’s own documentation about this system security level can be found [here](https://ww1.autotask.net/help/content/4_Admin/1CompanySettings_Users/ResourcesUsersHR/Resources/API_User_Add_Edit.htm).
5. Hover over <img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 4.34.56 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to the right of the API user. Click **Copy** in the dialog that appears. This will open a new tab in your browser.
6. Enter a descriptive name which includes Rewst in the text in the **Name** field.
7.  Scroll down and expand the **Other** accordion menu. Ensure that the **can create webhooks** box is checked on, and the **maximum number of webhooks** is set to `50`.\

   1. **Filter**: Choose what you would like filtered from the drop-down selector.
   2. **Operation**: Choose which operation you would like to use.
   3. **Value**: This must be an integer. The below guide is an example for how this may be used.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Accepted company type values**

Ensure you enter the number for the company type you would like to filter on.

```
1 = Customer
2 = Lead
3 = Prospect
4 = Dead
6 = Cancelation

## Webhook setup for triggers

By default, the Datto Autotask API User system security level does not have permission to create company webhooks. When you configure a trigger in the Rewst platform, you'll receive an error message stating that the webhook could not be created. To resolve this, you'll need to create a new security level by doing the following:

1. Log in to Datto Autotask.
2. Navigate to **Admin > Account Settings & Users**.
3. Click **Security Levels** on the **Resources / Users (HR)** tab.
4. Find the **API User (system) (API-only)** security level on the context menu.
5. Select **Copy**.
6. Scroll down to the **Other** tab.
7. Check the checkbox for **Create Company Webhooks**.
8. Enter a number. Each trigger will require at least one webhook.
9. Click **Save**.  &#x20;
10. Edit the user you are using to authorize Rewst and set it to this new security level.

{% hint style="success" %}
With this, you should now be able to create webhooks in Rewst. This will happen automatically when you create a trigger such as `Datto - Ticket Record Saved`.
{% endhint %}
