# Notion integration

{% hint style="info" %}
If you’re new to integrations in Rewst, read through our introductory integration documentation [here](https://docs.rewst.help/documentation/integrations).

Notion's documentation for how to create Notion integrations may also be helpful, and can be found [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) and [here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions).&#x20;

## What does the Notion integration do?

Our Notion integration enables teams to automate document creation, database management, and collaboration workflows directly within Rewst. By connecting to Notion, users can programmatically create and update pages, manage content blocks, and interact with databases as part of larger automated processes. This makes it easy to centralize information, keep documentation in sync, and enhance team communication without manual work.

## Why use the Notion integration?

* Turn emails into formatted Notion pages with attachments
* Log form submissions, such as customer feedback, directly into databases
* Generate daily standups from calendar events and enable team comments
* Monitor databases for high-priority items and trigger alerts
* Auto-generate client onboarding docs from templates
* Sync task statuses between Notion and other project tools
* Capture meeting minutes and distribute them automatically
* Manage a blog content calendar as writers submit drafts
* Use Notion databases as structured storage within broader automation flows

3. Click on the integration tile to launch the configuration setup page.
4. Enter the key copied from Notion into the **Internal Integration Secret** field.&#x20;

## Test the integration

Saving your configuration during integration setup automatically triggers a test API call to verify that your setup is correct. If something is wrong with your credentials and the integration fails, you'll receive an error message in the Rewst platform.

## How to use the Notion integration

Notion grants access for the integration on a page-by-page basis. Add each desired page as a connection within Notion by completing the following steps.

1. Navigate to your desired page in Notion. Alternatively, create a new page for your intended purpose.
2. Click **...** to open the actions menu.
3. Click + **Add Connections**.
4. Search for the Rewst integration and select it.&#x20;
5. Confirm that the integration can access the page and all of its child pages.\
