# Rewst's technical documentation guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to Rewst's Technical Documentation Guidelines. Here, we delve into the specifics and technical expectations required to create best-in-class documentation, all while maintaining the distinctive Rewst voice and tone.

***

## Core Principles

***

### Clarity and Precision

* **Technical Accuracy:** Ensure every piece of information is technically correct and up-to-date.
* **Detail-Oriented:** Provide comprehensive details without overwhelming the reader. Focus on essential elements to guide users effectively.

### Consistency

* **Standardized Format:** Use a consistent structure across all documents. This includes headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists for easy navigation.
* **Terminology:** Maintain uniformity in terms. If a specific term is used to describe a feature or process, stick to it throughout the documentation.

### Approachable Technical Language

* **Balancing Technicality and Accessibility:** While technical accuracy is key, the language should be approachable. Avoid overly complex jargon.
* **User-Centric Writing:** Frame technical details in a way that resonates with the user's experience. Explain how features and processes benefit them.

### Engaging and Interactive Content

* **Visual Aids:** Incorporate diagrams, screenshots, and videos where appropriate to aid understanding.
* **Interactive Elements:** Include step-by-step tutorials, interactive examples, or simulations to enhance engagement.

## Documentation Structure

### Introduction

* **Objective:** Clearly state the purpose of the document. What will the user learn or accomplish by the end?
* **Scope:** Define the scope of the content. What aspects of the product or feature will it cover?

### Body

* **Sequential Flow:** Information should flow logically, building upon each concept or step.
* **Actionable Steps:** Present instructions or information in actionable steps, ensuring they are easy to follow and implement, including examples and visuals where relevant.

### Conclusion

* **Recap:** Briefly summarize key points or steps.
* **Further Resources:** Link to related documents or external resources for additional learning.

## Dos and Don'ts

***

### Do:

* Use a friendly, conversational tone, as if explaining concepts to a colleague over coffee.
* Include real-life examples or use cases to demonstrate application.

### Don't:

* Overwhelm the reader with technical information without practical context.
* Stray from the Rewst tone of being direct and succinct.
