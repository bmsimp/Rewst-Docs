# Webhook trigger rate limits

{% hint style="info" %}
_Rate limiting_ is a technique to control the number of requests a user or application can make to a service within a specific time frame. It's used to prevent system overload, ensure fair usage, and protect against attacks like DDoS or scraping by temporarily slowing or rejecting requests that exceed predefined limits.

Rewst will enable rate limits for our webhook triggers on February 17, 2026. Existing customers should see the section [Existing customer rate limit transition](webhook-trigger-rate-limits.md#existing-customer-rate-limit-transition) for instructions on how to prepare.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To ensure platform reliability and consistent performance for the entire platform, Rewst applies rate limits to inbound webhook triggers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Current limits per trigger

* 25 requests per second
* 1000 requests per minute

These limits apply individually to each webhook trigger, not to your organization as a whole. Our integrations operate well within these thresholds under normal conditions.

The rate limit occurs at ingest rather than after trigger criteria are considered.
{% endhint %}

## Common causes of rate limit errors

* Misconfigured integrations sending duplicate events
* Bulk operations triggering large volumes of webhooks simultaneously
* Retry storms from upstream services

## Response when limit is exceeded

If your webhook traffic exceeds our limits, Rewst will respond with an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status code. This is a [standard response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status) that signals the sending service to [slow down and retry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Retry-After), and is displayed in the header of the webhook response.&#x20;

As webhook requests originate from external platforms, Rewst can't retry the request on your behalf. The event is lost once it's rejected, unless the external platform is configured to retry on 429 responses. Most well-designed webhook senders will automatically back-off and retry when they receive a 429 response. WHRL However, note that Rewst has built integrations with MSP-requested tools, and not all tools have 429 responses built in yet.&#x20;

## How to resolve and prevent rate limit issues

{% hint style="warning" %}
Naive immediate retries will cause loops and continued rate limiting.
{% endhint %}

* Review your integration configuration to ensure that events aren't being sent multiple times.
* Verify that upstream services are correctly handling 429 responses and implementing back-off.
* If you're performing bulk operations, consider spacing them out over time.
* Add delays or exponential back-off before retrying.&#x20;
* Filter events before sending requests. Configure the source system to only emit webhook events that are actually needed: limit event types, scopes, objects, environments, etc.
* If supported, batch or consolidate events. Prefer sending fewer webhook requests that contain multiple changes or events, or use built-in batching aggregation options on the source platform to reduce request volume.
* Contact [Rewst support](../support-and-community/roc-support/) if you need further guidance on how to prevent rate limiting.

## Existing customer rate limit transition

Rewst recommends evaluating your applications that send automated HTTP requests to Rewst before the transition date to ensure your webhook triggers are not exceeding the fair use limits put in place.
