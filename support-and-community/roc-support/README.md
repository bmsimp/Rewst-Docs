# Rewst support

## What is the ROC?

Short for _Robotic Operations Center_, the ROC is Rewst’s dedicated support team, here to assist with all platform-related questions, technical guidance, and automation best practices. They're not a fit to talk about account issues or commercial needs such as contract, billing, or general relationship questions. For those, please contact your Rewst CSM.

**Other Rewst employees who help**

During your onboarding process, you'll be assigned an &#x61;_&#x75;tomation strategist_, or _AS_, to help you get set up. If you're experiencing issues during your onboarding process, reach out to your automation specialist as your first step.

Once you're through Rewst onboarding, you'll be assigned a _customer success advisor_, or _CSA,_ for all your account needs. Reach out to your CSA for all your strategic, but not necessarily technical, questions and concerns.
