# Rewst support

## What is the ROC?

Short for _Robotic Operations Center_, the ROC is Rewst’s dedicated support team, here to assist with all platform-related questions, technical guidance, and automation best practices. They're not a fit to talk about account issues or commercial needs such as contract, billing, or general relationship questions. For those, please contact your Rewst CSM.

## Rewst support operating hours

Our support team provides **24-hour coverage from Monday to Friday**, ensuring uninterrupted assistance across the globe. Due to our global presence, our actual coverage runs from:
