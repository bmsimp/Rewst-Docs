# Rewst support

## What is the ROC?

Short for _Robotic Operations Center_, the ROC is Rewst’s dedicated support team, here to assist with all platform-related questions, technical guidance, and automation best practices. They're not a fit to talk about account issues or commercial needs such as contract, billing, or general relationship questions. For those, please contact your Rewst CSM.

## Rewst support operating hours

Rewst support is available for responses and support assistance Monday thru Friday, 4AM to 9PM Eastern.

Learn more about our support priority levels [here](support-priorities.md).&#x20;

## How to log a support ticket

To create a support request, you have several options.

* You can send a message to our team via your private customer channel in Discord. We aim to respond to these messages within 60 minutes.
* [Use the command to create a ticket from a message](create-a-ticket-via-discord.md). This will alert our support team and they'll respond as quickly as possible.
* Email us at [roc@rewst.io](mailto:roc@rewst.io)
