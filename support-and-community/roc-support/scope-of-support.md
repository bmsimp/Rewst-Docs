# Scope of support

## What is included in Rewst support

To clarify what our support team provides and the scope of our services, here are the guidelines we follow to ensure a smooth and productive experience for all customers.

### Issue troubleshooting

Our support team is here to help you troubleshoot issues and ensure the application functions as intended. This includes support for the following

1. Application functionality - We can confirm expected behavior and bug escalation of all areas of the application. This includes:
   1. Workflow action behavior
   2. Application interface behavior
   3. Native integration behavior and configuration - We support all aspects of our native integrations and can advise on the settings required in the third party application that are required for our native integration to operate correctly.
   4. Custom integration behavior - We support troubleshooting issues with our Custom Integration functionality only. Whilst we can provide assistance in getting a custom integration configured on a best endeavor basis, we do not support the custom integration or the third party application you are integrating with.
2. Crate functionality - We can confirm expected behavior and bug escalation of our prebuilt Crates. This includes their forms, workflows, triggers, scripts, templates and apps.
3. Support access - We can ensure you have access to our support team via our support communication tools:
   1. Halo PSA
   2. Discord

### Consulting guidance

We provide guidance to address specific concerns or clarify best practices on a fair-use and best-effort basis, aligned with our below Abuse Prevention Policy.

1. What we do - Offer recommendations and advice to help you achieve your goals.
2. What we donâ€™t do
   1. Create custom automations on your behalf, such as workflows, forms, templates, scripts, apps, or integration configuration
   2. Provide bespoke training: we have a robust[ library of documentation along with multiple training courses and live training sessions](../getting-started.md).&#x20;
3. Boundary for customization - If your needs go beyond troubleshooting or troubleshooting calls, such as extended workflow building, our customer success managers (CSMs) or services teams will assist you in taking next steps.

### Limitations

**Third party software**\
\
Rewst will assist with problem analysis to help determine whether the root cause lies within Rewst or an external third-party service.\
If we determine that the issue is not caused by Rewst and can be clearly isolated to a third-party system, ongoing support must be handled by the respective vendor.



**Experimental features**\
\
As outlined in our [Terms of Service](https://rewst.io/terms-of-service), Rewst may occasionally release experimental or beta features to give users early access and collect feedback. These features are still in development and may change or be removed without notice. These features come with no warranty or support, and documentation may be limited or unavailable. \
We welcome your feedback through the appropriate channels in the Rewst Community. Please avoid using experimental or beta features in production-critical workflows, and be sure to back up any data that could be affected.
